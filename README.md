warriorsband
============

This is a website I created pretty much from scratch for the Waterloo Warriors Band when I was a member. It allows
administrators to sign up new members, manage existing members, and post events, and it allows members to provide
attendance responses to events, and maintain a profile to share with others. Security, reliability, and ease of use were
priorities; admittedly, style was not, as you could tell if you viewed the pages.

As far as I know, it is still in use; however, I am no longer involved with the band or with maintenance of their website.
This repository contains the website code as it was at the end of my time there.
