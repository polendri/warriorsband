============

This repository is no longer being maintained.

This is a website created for the Waterloo Warriors Band while I was a member.
It allows administrators to sign up new members, manage existing members, and
post events, and it allows members to provide attendance responses to events,
and maintain a profile to share with others. Security, reliability, and ease of
use were priorities; admittedly, visual style was not, as you could tell if you
viewed the pages.

After a few years of service, the band has moved to a more permanent website
solution, and so this site is no longer in use. I keep this repository around
as a reminder to myself --- and to anyone else who may be curious --- that I
know some basic HTML, PHP and SQL.
