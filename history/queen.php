  In 1979 the Warriors Band extended a Honourary membership to the Queen and 
  received this reply. The original has the crest of Buckingham Palace.

  Dear Mr Hayman,
</p>
<p>
  I am commanded by The Queen to thank you for your letter of 20th September 
  and for your kind message of loyal greetings, which you have sent on behalf 
  of the University of Waterloo Warriors Band. Her Majesty also appreciated 
  your invitation to visit the Warriors Band next time she is in the Waterloo 
  area in Ontario.
</p>
<p>
  Yours Sincerely,
</p>
<p>

  Refusing to neglect our national duty, the ever-thoughtful warriors band 
  invites Prince Charles and Lady Diana to join us. The reference in the 
  P.S. is from the Honourary membership sent to, and accepted by Queen 
  Elizabeth II in 1979

  The Unviersity of Waterloo Warriors Band would like to extend our 
  congratulations on your upcoming marriage. You are hereby named honourary 
  members of this band, and may play any instrument you wish, whenever you 
  want. We would like to offer our services for this occasion, and would 
  gladly make the trip over to play at your reception. If, however, you have

  You are most welcome to play with the Band any time that you happen to be in 
  the Kitchener-Waterloo area.
