There should be a file in this directory called database.php, containing the
following code. If you are viewing this through the github repo, database.php
is not there, so that our password is not shown in plaintext. You could get
things working by creating a config.php file yourself with the following
content, modified appropriately.





<?php

/*
 *  database.php
 *
 *  Connect to the database with the provided parameters
 */

//Database connection parameters
$username = "warriorsband";
$password = "PASSWORD";
$hostname = "localhost";
$database = "DATABASENAME";

//You should not need to edit this
$mysqli = new mysqli($hostname, $username, $password, $database);
if ($mysqli->connect_errno) {
  echo "Failed to connect to MySQL database.";
}
?>
