<p>Letter to Steve Hayman;</p>
<p>Dear Steve,</p>
<p>On behalf of the City 
  of Kitchener Parks and Recreation Department and the Kitchener Olympic 
  Torch Organizing Committee, I am extending a sincere thank you to all 
  of the members of the University of Waterloo Warriors band for their participation 
  in the Olympic Torch Relay Ceremonies at Kithcener City Hall on Tuesday, 
  January 5.</p>
<p>We appreciated the enthusiasm 
  that you band members exhibited despite teh chilling temperatures and 
  the effects that the cold temperatures had on many of your instruments.</p>
<p>We hope that you enjoyed 
  being a part of the Olympic Torch Relay Ceremonies in Kitchener, and to 
  be able to Share the Flame/Celebrate the Spirit with several thousand 
  other people.</p>
<p>Yours Sincerely,</p>
<p>John Cooper, Chairman</p>
<p>Kitchener Olympic Torch 
  Relay Committee</p>
