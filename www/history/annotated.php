<p>"During 
  that ... 1966 season, math student Dave Greenberg started up the Warriors 
  Band in order to get into the games for free. "One time we were playing 
  and it started to rain," he recalls. "We decided to stay around 
  and play some cheers. That turned the crowd around, and the team noticed. 
  The Lettermen offered to get us some uniforms. We started saying, hey, 
  there's money there, what can we spend it on? So we bought the big bass 
  drum." From that point on, the Carling Red Cap Hymn became a fixture 
  at UW games."</p>

<p>Fan support 
  at the hockey games has dropped off at the last two games but those fans 
  attending the games are to be commended. With the aid of the Warrior band, 
  a tradition has been started. Don't know what it is? Well then attend 
  the next Warrior game and find out!</p>

<p>Warriors 
  Band</p>
<p>"The 
  Warriors Band is a hard-living, hard-loving, soft-drinking group of dedicated 
  musicians committed to rally school spirit at football, and hockey games, 
  etc., at home and away. The group's members can be seen around campus 
  in their yellow W-B sweaters shrieking their rallying cry, "Guard 
  the Bass Drum!" or "Practice?--What's That?"=2E Good musicianship 
  is not a necessary quality.</p>
<p>Further 
  information may be obtained from David Greenberg, 83 Marshall S., Waterloo, 
  745-1855, or Carnegie Hall."</p>

<p>The Chevron</p>
<p>"The 
  Warrior's band has had plenty of opportunity to learn the school song 
  at the last few games. They have established such all-time favourites 
  as 'The Death March' and 'Red Cap Forever'. "The band is currently 
  trying to bring 'Yellow Bird' up to its well-established level of incompetence 
  as a Homecoming present to the Lutheran Golden Hawks," said David 
  Greenberg, chief centurion of the band. "We don't want to add marching 
  to our already impressive list of failures and decided to put a float 
  in the Homecoming parade," he continued."</p>

<p>Fall 1968</p>
<p>We had 
  a request from Queens University for our school song since the football 
  team was playing there in a couple of weeks. They informed us that their 
  song was sung to the tune of "The Battle Hymn of the Republic". 
  The letter was addressed to the University of Waterloo WINDSOR Ontario, 
  which called for a proper response. I sent the following response (as 
  well as I can remember it) along with the original (Pre Steve Hayman) 
  arrangement of our school song.</p>
<p>"To 
  whom if just might perhaps possibly concern:</p>
<p>I am sorry 
  for taking so long to respond to your request, but your letter was addressed 
  to the University of Waterloo in Windsor Ontario. The University of Waterloo 
  is in Waterloo Ontario. The University of Windsor is in Windsor Ontario. 
  For a better explanation of this please attend Map Reading 265, a second 
  year Arts course here at Waterloo. The school song you suggested in enclosed. 
  You will notice that it is arranged for a skeleton crew, with the B flat 
  instruments playing from the same 3 parts, the bass clef instruments playing 
  from a single part, etc. There is no percussion part; they always play 
  whatever the hell they want anyway. I do not know the tune you say Queens' 
  uses for a school song, but should the need arise for us to play it (should 
  Queens score a point)[note: we were clobbered, we might have scored 1 
  point, but not much more], we will send our bass drummer over to listen 
  to the tune and we will pick it up from him. I look forward to the game.</p>
<p>Yours etc, 
  and redundantly so on.</p>
<p>David Greenberg</p>

<p>We arrived 
  in Queens and after playing a song or two, we were warmly greeted by a 
  band member who in spite of having heard us and seen us, invited us to 
  play half of the half time show. We did this, up to our usual standard 
  complete with Carling's Red Cap Beer Flag and a portable toilet (which 
  was used to carry the music). Six years or so later, when my sister went 
  to Queens to study music, the Band was still famous for the letter and 
  the half time show.</p>

<p>Dear Hard-Studying 
  Warriors Band Member,</p>
<p>The Creative 
  Art Board is considering bringing in the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and 
  putting it in the new Gymnasium. Since we are going out to the game Friday, 
  and since we are almost a reasonable facsimile of music, I volunteered 
  us for this job on the understanding that this is our sole contribution 
  to culture for a long time.</p>
<p>While in 
  the gym somebody will take our picture for Posterity.</p>
<p>Our inimitable 
  Chief Percussionist, Scott, has somehow arranged it so that if we provide 
  CHYM with a tape (of us), they will play it (and we don't have to pay 
  them anything!!)</p>
<p>The fans, 
  the cheerleaders, the hockey team and numerous coaches have been screaming 
  for our presence at hockey games, (even to the point of letting us play 
  O Canada).</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As previously 
  noted, this in all probability will be our last outing before January, 
  your presence is respectfully (but mandatorily) requested.</p>
<p>Yours with 
  Christmas Cheer,</p>
<p>David Greenberg</p>
<p>Chief Centurion 
  of Warriors Band</p>
<p></p>
<p>December 
  9, 1968</p>
<p>Dear Cherished 
  Warriors Band Member:</p>
<p>I hope 
  you've been listening to CHYM where honourary member Brian (Cuddles) Gillis 
  has been playing fairly regularly our burnt offerings and musical sacrifices. 
  Brian has offered to come out and play with us just as soon as his mother 
  will let him out with his kazoo (Brian also gets copies of this letter).</p>
<p>For those 
  wondering about what games we will be playing at next term, the new just 
  revised policy is:</p>
<p>There will 
  be one (1) :"official" game per week (as you shall be informed 
  by letter). If there are any other home games that week and you are planning 
  on going, take your instrument and meet anybody else that is going 45 
  minutes before game time. We hope this way we will have somebody at every 
  game, and will try to get at least one trumpet player and one drummer 
  every time. For this, I have arranged to get Band Members season's passes 
  to hockey and basketball games.</p>
<p>Those people 
  who are going out on work terms, or are changing addresses next term and 
  who still want to receive these humorous, witty, and profound statements 
  irregularly every week, should send the new address to ME c/o Creative 
  Arts Department, University of Waterloo. Those wishing not to receive 
  this senseless, mindless, sandbox trivia can best do it by changing addresses 
  and not telling me.</p>
<p>Looking 
  back on the past season, we can be proud that we have the most unique 
  half-time non-show in existence. It seems that we are the cause of the 
  new movement to have the Stripper replace O Canada. The results of the 
  Playboy Jazz Poll will be known when the February issue of Playboy come 
  out (which you all know is in January).</p>
<p>So until 
  next year (The Chinese year of the Warrior) - </p>
<p>COOL YULE 
  AND HAPPY CHANUKAH,</p>
<p>Yours excessively,</p>

  Recovering from New Year's Eve Warrior Band Member:</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Please

<p>January

<p>Dear Bubbling, 
  Epervescent, Exuberant, Enthusiastic Warriors Band Member:</p>
<p>SMILE! 
  This Wednesday (January 15th) University of Waterloo verses University 
  of Toronto in hockey, or more important, the Warriors Band verses the 
  Lady Godiva Memorial Band for the best organized non-organized, nonmusical, 
  nonsensical band.</p>
<p>All people 
  in the band who are coming and have cars please be prepared to drive, 
  then we can pick out the cars most likely to survive the trip, and put 
  17 people and one tuba in each and go. (Seriously, all cars are needed).</p>
<p>So until 
  Wednesday I'll leave you considering my latest risque math book Tropic 
  of Calculus.</p>
<p>Yours sparingly,</p>
<p>David Greenberg</p>
<p>Chief Centurion, 
  Warriors Band</p>
<p>P.S. Due 
  to the efforts of Trumpeter Christopher Moon, we are organizing a Pep 
  Rally Sock Hop to be held after the Western B-Ball Game Saturday, January 
  25th.</p>
<p>P.P.S. 
  Don't plan too much for the week of February 2 - 8. There is a high probability 
  we will all be in FASS Night (similar to the probability that it will 
  be windy in Waterloo on a given day).</p>

<p>Dear Travelling 
  W.B. Member:</p>
<p>Further 
  details on last week of home play:</p>
<p>Wednesday, 
  February 19. All cars are needed.</p>
<p>5:30 Meet 
  at the people's practise pad.</p>
<p>6:00 Leave 
  for T.O.</p>
<p>7:45 Meet 
  outside at Bloor entrance (those that don't have tickets)</p>
<p>8:00 Game 
  time.</p>
<p>10:30 or 
  so - after game we will go some place (not Harvey's at Jarvis and Wellesley)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>N.B. There 
  is much music out, anyone having or knowing the whereabouts of any folders 
  or books please get them in P.D.Q.</p>
<p>A little 
  note about hockey playoffs. They are February 28 evening and March 1 in 
  Toronto not Montreal as first thought. Anybody whose home is in T.O. is 
  asked to request to his parents or guardian that they (he or she) put 
  up a finite number of W.B. members (35 or less) for the Friday night, 
  February 28. They (he/she) are not expected to provide any meals and band 
  members will supply their own (security) blankets (and pacifiers) if requested 
  to do so in a nice tone of voice.</p>
<p>Again all 
  cars, busses and bicycles will be needed for what is annually the biggest 
  W.B. excursion of the season.</p>
<p>PLAN AHEAD! 
  Buy Victory bonds!</p>
<p>Until we 
  next encounter one another</p>
<p>I remain 
  yours without music.</p>
<p>David Greenberg</p>
<p>Chief Centurion 
  W.B.</p>
<p>P.S. Get 
  music back soon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>February 
  25, 1969</p>
<p>Dear W-B 
  Member:</p>
<p>As the 
  sunset falls on another sunny succulent season of the glorious people's 
  band, we must keep in mind that the climax has yet to come. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Detail 
  1. Look around for signs of a pep rally dance at the Village, if there 
  is one, we shall play at it. Meet at 8:00 P.M.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Detail 
  2. Schedule for T.O.</p>
<p>Meat at 
  3:30</p>
<p>Leive at 
  4:01</p>
<p>Pleigh 
  at 6:03 (Meet at 5:45 or sooner outside)</p>
<p>All cars 
  wanted and loved.</p>
<p>Bring your 
  own blankets or sleeping bag.</p>
<p>We will 
  decide on Thursday March 2 what we will officially open (close) in T.O. 
  on Saturday.</p>
<p>3. The 
  Society of Malicious Musical Masochists (The Athletic Dept.) has asked 
  that we perform in the final two games of the Canadian B.Ball championships 
  and play half time shows then. This is Saturday, March 8. Meet at 7:00 
  (We even get to play O Canada.)</p>
<p>4. You 
  should soon receive invitations to the Athletic Banquet on March 11, we 
  usually go at combatants rates and as for everybody, a date costs money. 
  More details later.</p>
<p>Come to 
  Toronto.</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Dave</p>
<p></p>
<p>March 4, 
  1969</p>
<p>Dear Almost 
  Finished But Definitely Not Quite Warriors Band Member:</p>
<p>Tuesday, 
  March 11 at 6:30 p.m. is A.A. banquet (Athletic Awards). We are among 
  the few people who get in free. You should get an invitation from the 
  athletic department to go down and pick up your ticket in the P.E. building. 
  Dress is suits (dresses) and helmet (wear shoes). Meet at 5:45 p.m. since 
  we must drive to the Breslau hotel to get organized.</p>
<p>It has 
  been noted that I am the head of Waterloo's longest lasting (3 years) 
  dictatorship, (having never called an election). Since in 69-70 I may 
  do something stupid like graduate and leave I feel that we should do something 
  to set up some sort of constitution or charter or manifest to ensure that 
  the people of Waterloo suffer forever the abuses to music made by the 
  W.B.</p>
<p>After Saturday's 
  B.Ball games we should all go to Frostop and have a general meeting and 
  discuss hits. I shall be around next year, but should probably play a 
  reduced part due to my responsibilities (irresponsibilities) of Vice President 
  of Federation of Students.</p>
<p>Yours probably 
  forever,</p>

<p>September 
  1969</p>
<p>Dear Glorious 
  Warriors Band Member:</p>
<p>I hope 
  that none of you have practised over the summer - so that we can reach 
  the depths of musical depression that we achieved late last year by early 
  this fall.</p>
<p>This year 
  we shall be trying something new: when you report this fall, please have 
  clear in your mind exactly which note you would like to specialize in. 
  (typical bad grammar - typist's note)</p>
<p>Out of 
  our discussions last spring the Chief Centurion (and we all know who he 
  is, don't we?) has purchased himself a brand-new 1963 Econoline van (which 
  proceeded to attack him and put him in the hospital for a week - typists's 
  note). This noble vehicle shall hereafter be referred to respectfully 
  as the Peoples' Band's Van.</p>
<p>Enclosed 
  (hopefully) you shall find a schedule for the coming season. Please note 
  that, except for early exhibition games, all games are easily accessible 
  to the glorious (?) Peoples' Band and thus we can express our musical 
  malcontent over a wider area than ever before.</p>
<p>Yours summerly,</p>
<p>Dave Greenberg</p>

  of Warriors Band</p>

<p>Cherished 
  Old and New Warriors Band Members.</p>
<p>Welcome 
  (back) to Canada's largest society of Musical Agnostics. Armed with our 
  rallying cries:</p>
<p>a) Guard 
  the Bass Drum</p>
<p>B) Practise! 
  What's that?</p>
<p>III) Clean 
  mind, Clean body - take your pick</p>
<p>AND</p>
<p>4) This 
  band will self-destruct in 14 bars of any song you want to name -</p>
<p>(Recently 
  changed to - this band will self-destruct in any 14 songs in any bar you 
  want to name)</p>
<p>We shall 
  continue with our task of promoting tone deafness and stamping out rhythm 
  methods the world over.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Be prepared 
  to attend all football games, home and away, the attendance rule being, 
  anybody not at 1/2 the preceding games must pay for his/her/other's ticket 
  as well as suffer the traditional penalty (death).</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Anybody 
  knowing the whereabouts of any of our black music folios should immediately 
  contact J. Edgar Hoover, the campus cops, Ann Landers and/or possibly 
  get them returned to the W.B. all-purpose music bag.</p>
<p>We'll see 
  you Monday.</p>
<p>Yours anyway</p>

<p>To Whom 
  it just might perhaps possibly concern:</p>
<p>You are 
  cordially invited to join The Waterloo Musical Paraplegics (Warriors Band) 
  in the annual non-playing of music at the Queens - Waterloo football game.</p>
<p>Meet at 
  12:30 AL 6.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Saturday, 
  Oct. 4/69</p>
<p>Some veterans 
  will remember the reception we received down in Queen's last year, and 
  no doubt Queens students will be looking for Band Souveniers (helmets, 
  sweaters, Tubas, false teeth, etc.) when they arrive. Since helmets will 
  be the main target, please follow these simple directions when putting 
  on helmet.</p>
<p>1. Place 
  helmet on head.</p>
<p>2. Take 
  helmet straps in left hand.</p>
<p>3. Insert 
  in left ear &amp; push through to right ear.</p>
<p>4. Tie 
  in triple non-slipping knot.</p>
<p>5. Glue 
  with all-weather cement.</p>
<p>If you 
  follow these instructions, we will lose fewer helmets, but perhaps the 
  odd head.</p>
<p>Please 
  note that we are meeting early to avoid a hassle for our seats.</p>
<p>Yours extremely,</p>
<p>Dave Greenberg</p>

<p>"HARK, 
  "MUSICIANS" OF THE WARRIOR BAND"</p>
<p>The greatest 
  leader of the "Society For Tasteless Music", D.G., and I are 
  placing a call (trumpet) to all the faithful of the "Peoples Band", 
  to combine one night a week to produce amongst us all "The Sounds 
  of Music".</p>
<p>The cast 
  of this Academy Award winning production will be without Julie, that is 
  "Mary Poppins" and her six or seven kids, but will be replaced 
  by Alfred Kunz, the "Rogers &amp; Hammerstein" of Waterloo. 
  This production needs a cast of French Horns, Clarinets, Saxes, Trumpets, 
  Basses, Baritones (and Euphs), Flutes, Drummers, exotic instruments, and 
  finally musicians to be the backstage helpers to the above soloists.</p>
<p>The GREAT 
  HAPPENING will be occurring weekly, every Wednesday night, in Arts Lecture 
  6, music rehearsal room, at 5:30 to 7:00. If all of us participate, a 
  Concert Band will be born, a band of which each of us, and Waterloo, can 
  be proud.</p>
<p>Yours musically,</p>
<p>Jad Dodsworth</p>
<p>P.S. D.G., 
  that is David Greenberg, has promised to relinquish the death penalty, 
  or what is worse, has promised not to kick out any "practising" 
  Warriors Band member who joins this great "undertaking." Either 
  way we lose? Hope to see you all next Wednesday, Oct. 8th.</p>

<p>October

<p>Dear Frustrated 
  W.B. Member:</p>
<p>Once again, 
  National "Lets go home to Mother week-end" is at hand. Yet on 
  Saturday, October 11th, McMaster is here. Anybody in the near vicinity

<p>Dear (Bleep) 
  W.B. Member</p>
<p>After my 
  last (bleep) effort, my private Secretary has threatened to censor these 
  (bleep-bleep) letters.</p>
<p>This Saturday 
  is (bleep) of Western Ontario Homecoming. The suggestion has been made 
  - and agreed upon, that we crash their (bleep) homecoming parade. Our 
  flying (bleep) march formation has not yet been finalized, but the Chief 
  Centurion will ride in the Van while everybody else walks.</p>
<p>* * * MEET 
  AT 8:30 A.M. - AL-6 * * *</p>
<p>We will 
  try to leave by 9:00 A.M.</p>
<p>Rumour 
  has it the Parade starts at 10:30 A.M.</p>
<p>Just remember 
  to (bleep) and keep (bleep) or we will probably lose our (bleep-bleep) 
  and not be able to (bleep?)</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>David Greenberg</p>

<p>Dear Warriors 
  Band Member:</p>
<p>Having 
  successfully introduced ourselves to U.W.O. and the land of John Robarts, 
  we now venture to Hamilton and McMaster University.</p>
<p>McMaster 
  is the strangest University we've ever encountered, last year they invited 
  us to play a half time show after they heard us play.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Warning 
  - Nov. 1st is Homecoming - attendance rule (ie. all people not at 50% 
  of this years games since joining, must pay $1.00 for ticket) will be 
  in effect.</p>

<p>DEAR HANGOVER 
  PRONE W.B. MEMBER - </p>
<p>If your 
  address has changed since the last term, chances are you won't get this 
  letter, so send in your new address soon.</p>
<p>Enclosed 
  please find one (1) copy of tentative winter schedule. Please place it 
  somewhere you will see it and not lose it (like on your beer case). Separate 
  reminders will be coming out sporadically.</p>
<p>This term 
  the last game is the home T.O. game. If we are limited in tickets, then 
  tickets will go to those who have attended the most games this term.</p>
<p>Finally, 
  let me be the last person to wish you a very New Year.</p>

<p>Good Afternoon 
  Mr. Warriors Band Member:</p>
<p>Your assignment 
  this Saturday, January 24th, should you decide to accept, is to travel 
  to Windsor, and help the Warriors win against the fiendishly foul and 
  fabulous Windsor Lancers in Basketball. Leaving at 12:15 P=2EM. in the 
  afternoon, and coming back after the game, is calculated precisely to 
  allow dumb engineers a good part of the Weekend to Study Math 12-21. All 
  automobiles are needed, gas and tickets shall be paid for (reimbursed 
  for) out of our fabulous band fund. Should any member not come on this 
  trip and be destroyed by a flash of lightening, we will of course deny 
  all knowledge of his existence. This letter will immediately self destruct 
  in the hands of anyone whose I.Q. is greater than 3.</p>

<p>January 
  20, 1970</p>
<p>We went 
  to Windsor for a game which the Warriors won. After the game the coach 
  ran immediately to the band and told us we were worth more than the margin 
  of victory.</p>

  we play in Western for B.Ball. Meet at 10:30 A.M. AL&ETH;6. The early

  to our games always comment on the atmosphere in our gym, mainly created

<p>Maybe next

<p>Dear played

<p>One last 
  get together AL-6. Wed 6:30, (no instruments) - for the nostalgic presentation 
  of a proclamation of honourary CC-W-B&ETH;ship. Service will be short 
  so the 6:30 time is 6:30 not 6:30 +- 1 hour.</p>
<p>Get your 
  Summer address to me c/o W-B Creative Arts.</p>
<p>Bring 50 
  cents to help pay if you have not (penalty death; of course). Leave Summer 
  Weekend open (probably July 4 - 5).</p>

<p>Dear former

<p>Thank you 
  for the pencil holder - it's just what I needed.</p>
<p>Enclosed 
  you will find l (one) copy of W.B. report written in fluid prose and sharp 
  point form.</p>
<p>One serious 
  note (F#): Dave White will need every bit of co-operation that I got and 
  more if the band is to continue. It took five years to produce the state 
  of mental break down the former Chief Centurion now enjoys - be helpful:</p>
<p>Hatching 
  hopefully this summer is W-B first annual reunion at summer weekend (July 
  11, 12) - get your summer address in to Dave White or the Creative Arts 
  Box Office soon.</p>
<p>If anybody 
  is in Ottawa this summer drop in at 72 Renfrew Avenue - and leave a note

<p>Dave White, 
  C.C. bless his perverted soul, was a bit on the slack side this week, 
  so I must have needs take this pen in hand and attempt to spread this 
  lovely, moving, heart-rending message:</p>
<p>- Football 
  Game this Sat. Oct. 3, 2:00pm., at U. of Western Ont. in London, (Ontari-ari-O, 
  natch); of course you already knew that being conscientious band member, 
  at least you better, 'cause this letter hasn't a hope of reaching you 
  in time.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>- Bring 
  $1.50 for ticket since snobby ole Western is not nice place whom gives 
  tickets to opponents. (Hopefully to also be reimbursed)</p>
<p>- Most 
  of all, BRING YOURSELF &amp; INSTRUMENT (please)</p>

<p>Dear Warrior(ette);</p>
<p>I'm back 
  from a great work term in the "ville de Quebec" ready to follow 
  the Warriors Band in their efforts to "promote tone deafness and 
  stamp out the rhythm method the world over." WELCOME to all the new 
  recruits.=2E...... now to business.</p>
<p>Saturday, 
  Sept. 18 at 12:30----</p>
<p>Everyone 
  meet at our room in the Blue South corner of the Athletic complex. For 
  those without instruments we will have a special issue of new ones which 
  may be used for this game.</p>
<p>Instruments 
  may be rented (see price list) by seeing sweet Sandy Brown in the Cultural 
  Programme Centre, Modern Languages building.</p>
<p>GET YOUR 
  INSTRUMENTS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.......</p>
<p>delivery 
  takes about 14 days.</p>
<p>Some of 
  you more loyal members will soon be called upon to help paint our trailer 
  which now allows us to get to more away games.</p>
<p>I'm including 
  an olde band list to make sure that we have most of our members listed. 
  Please report any corrections as soon as you can.</p>
<p>Yours anyway,</p>

<p>Tuesday, 
  the 21st</p>
<p>day of 
  September in 1971</p>
<p>Dear fellow 
  music ? makers and those frosh (Whom I will deal with later) who didn't 
  memorize the World Famous Warrior Band slogan,</p>
<p>HI</p>
<p>The above 
  quotation from me is to put us all into a happy and optimistic mood about 
  our fearless Football Warriors. We will all take battle stations at 0815 
  on Saturday Morning, September 25th to do battle with the Gaels from Queens. 
  We will assemble at Blue South in the Jock building. Our battle cry for 
  the day will be:</p>
<p>"We 
  are the greatest band in the World"</p>
<p>There are 
  30 tickets available for this trip. Unfortunately, due to a decreased 
  budget (after buying our trailer) we are asking that each member pay a 
  dollar toward the $1.50 ticket. We are also desperately in need of cars 
  for the trip. Drivers will be paid gas mileage for the trip from our budget.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>From my 
  secret spies I am told that some of you frosh didn't learn our slogan 
  at the last football game. The guilty ones will all suffer the ultimate 
  humiliation of being slapped across the wrist with a very wet noodle by 
  our chief executioner, who will remain nameless. He strikes at any moment 
  so be prepared. I am also told that the band sounded good and played in 
  tune last Saturday. I hope that isn't true. Hopefully we can improve on 
  our image this Saturday.</p>
<p>love and 
  kisses</p>
<p>Jad</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tuesday, 
  Three days after another glorious victory</p>
<p>Dear members 
  of the Warriors Football Secret Service:</p>
<p>We will 
  all meet secretly, Friday Oct 8th at 1846 (6:46 p.m. for those who haven't 
  passed their 007 test) at Blue South a part of Uniwat's Secret Service 
  Building, to extend our winning streak to three games. Our secret service 
  group "The Warriors Band" has successfully infiltrated enemy 
  football teams with our particular brand of music and for some reason 
  have upset the opposition. I wouldn't know why.</p>
<p>Also keep 
  in mind Saturday Morning, October 9th, we might crash the Oktoberfest 
  Parade in Kitchener-Waterloo, if we have enough musicians?</p>
<p>Your Secret 
  Service Agent</p>
<p>Jad</p>
<p>P.S. After 
  you have read this report it will disintegrate in 5 seconds so MacMaster 
  won't find out about our plan and by now you should have burnt your hands.</p>
<p>P.S.S. 
  If you have music return it!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tuesday, 
  Three days AFTER???</p>
<p>Dear Friends 
  and Fellow Musicians:</p>
<p>It pains 
  my heart and soul that one of our objectives in this spy world failed 
  miserably last Saturday. I found out too late on shortwave that Super 
  Spy 002 was disposed of and interrogated so much so that he became the 
  conductor of the University of Western Ontario Concert Band and he advised 
  me with the wrong information. (The "Old Grey mare" is their 
  rally cry). Don't worry our executioner is ready -- with his wet noodles.</p>
<p>Now my 
  hearty friends, Saturday is our Homecoming against our uptown ??? rivals 
  from "Wuc, Wuc, Wuc, Wuc, Wuc," the Yellow Bird's rallying cry. 
  We are partaking, in fact leading the parade, (I think someone has misinformed 
  the parade commander of our musical abilities.) from Kitchener's Victoria 
  Park to Seagrams that Morning.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Tuesday, 
  4 days after</p>
<p>another 
  SUPER VICTORY</p>
<p>Dear Super 
  Spies:</p>
<p>We will 
  meet at the Super Spy Building (Jock Building) at 1000 hours (10:00 a.m.) 
  Sat. Oct. 16 to continue our super spy story. We have on good faith from 
  our super agent 002 in London, that the Mustangs will become very sedate 
  if we play the "old grey mare" for them. Thus our #2 theme song 
  will be "the olde grey mare" for their homecoming.</p>
<p>Drivers 
  again are desperately needed for the trip to London. Gas bills will be 
  paid for by the Warriors Band if receipts are forwarded to Creative Arts 
  Office by Wednesday of next week.</p>
<p>Your Super 
  Spy (001)</p>
<p>who will 
  be there in spirit and not in body,</p>
<p>Jad</p>

<p>Dear Warrior 
  Band Faithful:</p>
<p>As we draw 
  to the end of another successful year, I would like to take this opportunity 
  to thank all of you for keeping the Warrior Band alive &amp; sounding 
  "awful" this past year and hope we can all do a better job next 
  year. John Rudy, who has done an excellent job of running the band when 
  I wasn't available will be our Warrior Band Chief for the next year. I 
  hope all will give him the help and co-operation that I received this 
  year.</p>
<p>love and 
  kisses</p>

<p>Dear "Just 
  having got back and anxious to get going" Warriors band member.</p>
<p>Now that 
  you have gone through the hassles of registration and in the case of frosh, 
  finding your way around, you should be ready for an afternoon of fun and 
  relaxation.</p>
<p>The first 
  performance of the great and glorious Warriors Band just happens to coincide 
  with the afternoon. Therefore on Sat. Sept 16 we shall meet at Blue North 
  in the phys. ed. building to cheer the football Warriors on to victory 
  against Bishops. Meeting time is 1:00 PM (13:00 hrs for you military types)</p>
<p>Let's make 
  our first performance a good one. Remember our rallying cries.</p>
<p>"Guard 
  the bass drum", "This band stops at every 14th bar", "Clean 
  mind, clean body - take your choice," and "Practice? what's 
  that?"</p>

<p>Dear Bus 
  Riding Warriors Band Member</p>
<p>We have 
  won two games in a row and on Sat. Sept 30 we have a chance to make it 
  three. McMaster is in very rough shape. Six first string players are out 
  with injuries including the entire starting backfield.</p>
<p>Because 
  of lack of cars we will have to go by bus. Meet at Blue South one half 
  hour before bus time (Buy your own ticket in advance. You will be reimbursed 
  for 1/2 of the cost) Doug Young will be in charge of organizing. Give 
  him your name to help insure reimbersment. If I am able I will be there 
  to cheer the Warriors on to victory.</p>

<p>Dear "TV 
  star" Warriors Band member:</p>
<p>After our 
  great video triumph on Fri (Sat at 2:00 p.m. on channel 11). I hope we 
  don't become prima donnas. We came through loud and clear on the TV and 
  at one point, the announcer even made good reference to us.</p>

<p>Memoirs 
  of a Warriors Band Member 1973 - 1978</p>
<p>For those 
  of you who don't know or remember me, I attended the University of Waterloo 
  from 1973 to 1976, graduating with a B.A., majoring in music. The most 
  influential part of my education was the Warriors Band. It taught me to 
  always be on time, to play my guts out and to save something for a possible 
  overtime. I also learned the school song. I probably played it hundreds 
  of times in the six years I participated in the band.</p>
<p>My first 
  exposure was on a cool October afternoon at the home stadium down the 
  street. The team lost, as I was to see them do most of the season, but 
  the Warriors Band had a new member. I was grateful to find a place to 
  have fun, meet people and take my mind off my studies. The members were 
  interesting, different, and sometimes just plain loony. I fit in somewhere.</p>
<p>At that 
  time Doug Young was the CCWB. He had a habit of sending out notices for 
  the upcoming performances and having fun with our names (My letters came 
  addressed to Joe Blow Belliveau. I don't know what Canada Post thought 
  of this.) He always signed "Hugs &amp; Kisses, Doug". That first 
  year at school I was using a wheelchair to get around the campus, at least 
  until the snow came. By January I had my first car and privileged parking, 
  and most importantly a key for all the padlocks on campus. Thus I could 
  access any chained off roadway on the University grounds, including the 
  PAC. From then on my vehicle was the first choice for the band transportation. 
  I almost always went to the away games, with three or four extra people 
  and their instruments. Sometimes we managed to pack the small bass drum 
  into the trunk.</p>
<p>After the 
  typical basketball home game, it was off to the outlying pubs, at Bridgeport, 
  S. Agatha, The Blue Moon, The Lancaster House, etc. We were almost always 
  in a good mood as we usually won. The most memorable visit was to the 
  bar at Bridgeport. We went into the live entertainment section, paid the 
  cover charge and sat down at 2 or 3 tables to listen. The rock band was 
  just ending their set, so we pulled out our kazoos and played a rousing 
  version of the school song. We were great! The management disagreed, and 
  informed us that we were too rowdy. We were cut off and told to leave. 
  Doug insisted on seeing the manager himself, but to no avail. We had to 
  leave peacefully or be thrown out forcefully. We walked out the front 
  door, went around the corner to a side entrance into another quieter room 
  in the same hotel. They served us and we were happy. Later that evening, 
  a waiter from the other room saw us, recognized our yellow sweatshirts, 
  and threatened to throw us out again. We appealed to our current waiter, 
  who said we had caused no trouble, and had been good customers. We stayed, 
  but with a grim warning. We never held an impromptu performance in a bar 
  again.</p>
<p>In later 
  years bar-hopping declined and we started going to Mothers Pizza after 
  every home game. We could drink or eat or both. We had to tone down on 
  our rowdiness, and while we did receive a couple of warnings for our behaviour, 
  we generally had a good relationship with Mothers. We also frequented 
  other pizza joints for meetings and after-game celebrations, but I cannot 
  remember the specific names, as some of them went out of business (we 
  had nothing to do with that).</p>
<p>Self promotion 
  was important for the Warriors Band over the years. We were always looking 
  for new members. An occasional ad would appear in the Gazette such as 
  </p>
<p>"Warriors 
  Band Concert Saturday night at 7:00p.m. </p>
<p>in the 
  PAC. For your enjoyment, during intermission</p>
<p>a basketball 
  game will be played."</p>
<p>This showed 
  everyone our attitude and great sense of humour. We also provided running 
  jokes during the games for the fans and Public Service Announcements for 
  the referees.</p>
<p>"The 
  referee's seeing eye dog has just been run over by a truck"</p>
<p>"We 
  have an interview with the ref's mother - Rouff!"</p>
<p>"Hey 
  ref, if you had one more eye you'd be a Cyclops."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Another 
  series of jokes were Doctor, Doctor jokes.</p>
<p><br>
  "Doctor, Doctor, I broke my arm in 3 places.</p>
<p>Don't go 
  to those places!"</p>
<p>"Doctor, 
  Doctor, it hurts when I do this.</p>
<p>Don't do 
  that!"</p>
<p>"Doctor, 
  Doctor, I want another opinion.</p>
<p>Okay, you're 
  ugly too."</p>
<p>Is it any 
  wonder we had to recruit new members occasionally?</p>
<p>Being in 
  the Warriors Band sometimes was a dangerous pastime, and always dangerous 
  at out of town games. If our side was winning the game, the local fans 
  would decide that our big bass drum was too noisy and should be removed. 
  One hockey game in London was memorable when members of the junior football 
  squad from Western made a concerted effort to steal our drum. A few punches 
  were exchanged resulting in one member's glasses being broken. But the 
  Western Director of Athletics treated us well. He escorted us out of the 
  building at the end of the game (where a few thugs were waiting for us), 
  and paid for the glasses. We were lucky.</p>
<p>We had 
  similar though less violent problems in Guelph, WLU, and Toronto. Occasionally 
  it happened at the PAC when visiting fans would object to our presence 
  behind their team bench. Or maybe they objected to our version of Mickey 
  Mouse when their team came out. Or maybe they didn't like our jokes. Maybe 
  they were music critics with no taste. It was unfathomable to us.</p>
<p>It was 
  impossible to be a member of the Warriors Band and not get caught up in 
  the excitement of the games. When our team won we felt good for helping 
  them along. I am not aware of what the band has done since 1978, but I 
  remember the band attending one rugger game. The team was surprised to 
  see us, and the few but loyal fans thought we came from Mars. I also witnessed 
  2 National Championship victories, basketball and hockey. We received 
  gratitude from the Athletics Department and from the teams. After the 
  hockey championship (in Toronto) we were invited to the team victory party 
  back in Waterloo at the dressing rooms of the football stadium. Of course 
  there was lots of beer, we played the school song and had a great time. 
  During the mid-seventies, "streaking" was popular at the universities 
  and colleges, and during the party a couple of mystery streakers joined 
  the party. They wore only facemasks and hockey sticks. I believe they 
  were members of the hockey team as nobody in the band would do anything 
  like that. Honest.</p>
<p>I cannot 
  finish this without mentioning the music itself. We played the school 
  song and "Mickey Mouse" at every game. Other favourites were 
  Oktoberfest songs such as "A Tavern in the Town" and "Lichtensteiner 
  Polka=2E" Occasionally we tried a Sousa march ("The Liberty 
  Bell") or variations of our repertoire ("Mickey Minor"). 
  We all made mistakes and still managed to have fun. Members had a variety 
  of skills and experience, ranging from those who could only play the cymbals, 
  to almost professional players who belonged to the musician's union. The 
  rest of us fell into a common category of musicians who enjoyed being 
  part of a group with no practices, competition or commitment to be at 
  every performance. I enjoyed it so much that after graduation I stayed 
  a member as long as I lived in the area.</p>

<p>MEMORIES 
  FROM 1973 ON</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many band 
  members start with an interest in various sports, along with some musical 
  ability. I thought the latter excluded me until I discovered that enthusiasm 
  was more important. A good friend, Rick Devitt, invited me to join the 
  band's percussion section for the Naismith Classic in Nov 1973, and I 
  began to enjoy Waterloo in a whole new way.</p>
<p>NAISMITH 
  NOVEMBER 1973</p>
<p>The Naismith 
  Classic has always been one of the highlights of the band's year, and 
  1973 was no exception. Here I am as a rookie drummer, practising O CANADA 
  for the first time ever, at the game on live TV! Fortunately things started 
  to sound better as the Naismith progressed.</p>
<p>After the 
  game we were invited to play at a formal event, yes the Warriors Band 
  giving a CONCERT? This was no ordinary event, we were playing for beer! 
  Some folks in Village II were holding a keg party and they offered us 
  ALL THE BEER WE COULD DRINK if we played at their party. Doug Young, our 
  Chief Centurion, accepted of course, and we all enjoyed ourselves. (Doug, 
  Millie Tomakaro, Linda Key(nee Trimble), Linda Stinson, Rick Allen, Rick 
  Large, Rick Devitt, Joe "Blow" Beliveau, Kelly, and a few others) 
  This was when we discovered that we were too loud for Village I residents 
  (while walking through), but not loud enough for Village II tastes.</p>
<p>The next 
  evening of the Naismith, after the game we had a road trip out to Bridgeport 
  and the infamous Grand Hotel. One of our members was celebrating her 21st 
  birthday (Linda Stinson). When the hotel band finally took a break, we 
  decided it was time for some good music. We started with the school song, 
  on kazoos, then progressed to another favourite kazoo tune that she loved. 
  Around this point Linda decided to dance on the table. This sounded like 
  a good idea at the time, so we started to clear room on the table. Unfortunately, 
  this was stopped before it got started. Our waiter was A MUSIC CRITIC. 
  He had no appreciation for our kazoo talents, so he had us kicked out. 
  We ended up finishing the evening in the attached bar, without the Country 
  and Western band. I'm not sure if Linda ever did actually have the 21 
  beers that she originally planned for.</p>
<p>The lesson 
  we learned, was to practice at the game in preparation for the party afterwards.</p>
<p></p>
<p>WINDSOR 
  BASKETBALL JANUARY 1974</p>
<p>One Friday 
  afternoon our Chief Centurion (Doug Young) managed to convince Rick Large 
  (he had a car, well not exactly, it was a VW beetle), and a friend of 
  his (his parents lived in Windsor, so we could crash), and myself, to 
  go for A ROAD TRIP. On Friday evening Rick's friend gave us a grand tour 
  of the Windsor bars. I remember there were a lot of bars he wouldn't go 
  in, because he had seen shootings, stabbings, mob ownership, etc.. He 
  warned us that the ones he considered safe, had frequent brawls. This 
  was a scary introduction to the greeting we experienced the next night 
  at St Dennis Hall.</p>
<p>St Dennis 
  Hall was a small gym, but they were able to crowd about 3000 hostile fans 
  into it for a basketball game, especially when it was between current 
  arch rivals Windsor and Waterloo. The place was so tightly packed that 
  we could hardly move. We had no place in front of us for our instruments, 
  and the neighbouring fans kept trying to steal our instruments, music, 
  drumsticks, etc, right out of our hands. They even threatened facial renovations, 
  if Waterloo won the game. The crowd became even more upset with us, when 
  we started the game with our traditional beat. Unfortunately the Warriors 
  remained scoreless for over two minutes. The crowd cheered when Waterloo 
  finally scored, but I think it had more to do with us finally stopping 
  the noise. The team said they appreciated us making the trip to such a 
  hostile place, and we were almost relieved that they lost a very close 
  game. I remember riding all the way back from Windsor with the snare drum 
  on my lap, holding the seat back of the passenger seat forward. My frozen 
  legs finally woke up when big Doug Young got out of the passenger seat 
  at the rest stop. </p>
<p>LONDON 
  - HOCKEY FEBRUARY 1974</p>
<p>We went 
  to a hockey game, and a fight broke out. About a dozen of the Western 
  football players decided to claim a few souvenirs from the band. There 
  were only ten of us including the girls, so we felt outnumbered. They 
  tried to remove our Waterloo jackets, without undoing them first! Fortunately 
  they had been drinking enough that they had lost their sense of balance, 
  and we were able to pull and push them onto the wooden seat backs a few 
  rows below. Fortunately the Western Athletic director happened along and 
  the football players disappeared. After the game he ended up escorting 
  us out the door to our cars, where the football players were waiting for 
  us, until they saw the athletic director. He had us send a bill to the 
  athletic department so they could pay for any broken items, such as Rick 
  Allen's broken glasses.</p>
<p>We managed 
  to get two cars for the trip, but this meant Rick Allen's Buick held the 
  instruments, and about four passengers, while Rick Large's VW Beetle had 
  six passengers (The lightest person, Linda Stinson, had to stretch across 
  the laps of the three in the back). The ride home was uncomfortable, because 
  we had not been able to use the washroom since the first period! In the 
  back of the unheated beetle, we were very crowded cold, and wet! When 
  we finally got to the rest stop (just outside Kitchener), we discovered 
  that the floor had been scooping up slush from the road, and burying our 
  ankles in slush. Attendees other than the above included, Rick Devitt, 
  Doug Young, Linda Key (nee Trimble), Joe Beliveau, etc.</p>
<p>OTTAWA 
  - OUAA BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS MARCH 1974</p>
<p>Rick Devitt 
  and I negotiated a seat for ourselves, and the big drum, on the team bus 
  up to Ottawa. While we were standing waiting to board the bus, Carl Totzke 
  suggested that it might be better if we rented a van and drove to the 
  game with more of the band (he even said he MIGHT get us $50 to help with 
  gas). That gave us less than 24 hours to find a van, and get ten people 
  willing to share the costs. At first it didn't look too good, we had given 
  up guaranteed seats to the game but we couldn't get a hold of any band 
  members, and the only van I could get had no rear windows, and just the 
  driver and single passenger seat. Finally we got Doug Young who emptied 
  everything soft from his living room, (pillows, chesterfield cushions, 
  mattresses, etc) into the back of the van. His roommate didn't seem real 
  happy about having nothing to sit on for the weekend! This helped make 
  it bearable in the back, but then I wouldn't know because I was driving. 
  Eight people rode back there, playing cards, sleeping, etc=2E, all the 
  way to Ottawa.</p>
<p>The group 
  included Linda Key (nee Trimble), Linda Stinson and her roommate Glynis, 
  Rick Devitt and a friend from Guelph Marni, Doug Young, Charlotte Penrose 
  (nee Morrison), myself, and two others.</p>
<p>As we prepared 
  for the start of the game we noticed the TV cameras. Then we heard the 
  announcer say the now frequent "All stand while the Warrior Band 
  plays O CANADA"! Panic set in as we suddenly had to grab for music 
  for this unexpected request, YES WE DO TAKE REQUESTS.</p>
<p>As the 
  game progressed a few Waterloo fans started to move around us, even claiming 
  they had found the Gym by the sounds of the band from across the U of 
  O campus. Near the end of the game it was 10 PM and we still had not found 
  a place to stay. Finally a couple CO-OP students invited us to a party 
  at their house after the game. They didn't know that we planned an all 
  night party, including sleeping!</p>
<p>We all 
  had a great time. The team won the OUAA tournament. Glynis eventually 
  got engaged to one of the COOP students she meet there. And Carl Totzke 
  even got us the money a few days later.</p>
<p></p>
<p>TORONTO 
  - VARSITY ARENA - CIAU HOCKEY CHAMPIONSHIPS MARCH 1974</p>
<p>This was 
  the highlight of the year. I believe most of the above mentioned people 
  attended, plus a few more. We were greeted at the parking lot by the CBC 
  trying out a new portable video camera (it was still so big it had a shoulder 
  pad to support its 40 pound weight, plus cables to another guy carrying 
  the battery packs and video tape unit). They got us to play a few tunes 
  in the parking lot for the camera. We always loved the chance to get on 
  CBC nationwide TV!</p>
<p>We had 
  many alumni show up for the game, it was great. The Warriors won the CIAU, 
  of course, and Millie got the band invited to the team party at the Seagram 
  Gym, back in Waterloo. The party was a lot of fun. The moment some remember 
  was when one of the hockey players decided to STREAK the party. A secretary 
  from the university went to perform a return STREAK with him, but they 
  never returned. So much for equality.</p>
<p>BISHOPS 
  - LENNOXVILLE QUEBEC - FOOTBALL GAME SEPTEMBER 1974</p>
<p>This trip 
  include a group of band members jammed into the car for the 7 hour drive 
  to Bishops. We won the prize for being "THE BEST BAND IN THE PREGAME 
  PARADE". They didn't even care that we were the only band in the 
  parade. They give real prizes in Quebec, a 24 of BRADOR beer. We even 
  meet some Waterloo fans in the stands.</p>
<p>I transferred 
  to Loyola University in Montreal before the next season, but return frequently 
  for major events. While numerous notable events occurred over my subsequent 
  visits, none could exceed the enjoyment we had in the 1973-74 Warriors 
  band. It was all good fun and we would do it all over again.</p>

<p>Winter, 
  1975</p>
<p>My involvement 
  with the Warriors Band was as "chief percussionist" in the years 
  1975 - 76 and 1976 - 77 and as treasurer during the latter year, despite 
  knowing absolutely nothing about banging drums or financial matters. However, 
  as we had no musical standards at all, and next&ETH;to-no money (things 
  haven't changed much, have they!), I was ideally suited for both roles.</p>
<p>You may 
  wonder how I came to be involved with such an organization. I credit/blame 
  my organic chemistry lab partner Ken Creech (Chief Centurion in 1975-76), 
  who, in the winter of 1975 , invited me to attend the men's hockey semi-final 
  one Friday evening at Varsity arena. Unfortunately we lost to Toronto; 
  in fact, the day was one big disaster after another. We were rushing to 
  get through that afternoon's lab session so that we could leave early 
  for the game. But in our haste we broke a beaker, spilling at least half 
  of its contents - the product of several weeks' work - on the floor. Then, 
  I somehow managed to break a glass rod and stick it up a finger instead 
  of into the hole in the rubber stopper for which it was intended. Much 
  blood and a few stitches later, we decided to call it a day before we 
  could do any further damage. We deposited the bass drum in the trunk of 
  Ken's car and headed for Toronto expecting to catch up with the rest of 
  the Band, which had set out earlier, at Varsity Arena. However, once we 
  hit the 401, the weather turned nasty, traffic being slowed to a mere 
  crawl by freezing rain. We got there between, I think, the second and 
  third periods. The Band, distressed possibly by our late appearance and 
  Waterloo's failing fortunes on the ice, proceeded to have an argument, 
  and almost everybody left in a huff.</p>
<p>Upon further 
  reflection, however, perhaps it wasn't such a disaster after all. While 
  watching the end of the Waterloo-Toronto debacle and the next game (York 
  beat Western), Ken and I discovered a common interest in puns, limericks 
  and other verbal horseplay, and became good friends.</p>

<p>There were 
  not enough instruments to go around to the members. I was the junior member 
  of the Bass Drum Corps. So, Millie did the honours during the game between 
  Manitoba and Waterloo. I'll never forget Phil Goggins and his corner jumper 
  with 7 seconds left on the clock in what Brian Williams, who was broadcasting 
  at that time from the People's Gym, described as the most exciting basketball 
  game he had ever witnessed. It was sheer ecstasy in witnessing history 
  in the making. I can't believe that it was over 16 year ago! What a comeback 
  by the B-team in the last 5 minutes of that game!</p>

<p>September 
  1975</p>
<p>Our first 
  gig of the 1975 - 76 season was a football game at Seagram Stadium. Our 
  opponents from Western Ontario brought with them a busload of instruments 
  and band players in snazzy uniforms. By contrast, we numbered just four 
  on this particular occasion, our advertisements in The Chevron for people 
  to join the Warriors Band not yet having had the desired impact. We were 
  also caught short in the sartorial- splendour department, our "uniforms" 
  being three torn lab coats which I had borrowed from the Dean's lab, and 
  my orange ponchoraincoat. Those present for Waterloo, were Ken Creech 
  on trumpet, Ken Fudurich on clarinet, Jim Snyder on snares, and me on 
  bass drum. </p>
<p>We watched 
  in awe, prior to the commencement of the game, as the Western band marched 
  back and forth in front of the stands in precision formation, playing 
  their hearts out. They were good. Darned good. They stopped in front of 
  the centre of the stands, instruments poised, waiting only for the announcement 
  asking all to rise for the playing of "O Canada". But to everyone's 
  complete surprise, the announcer said WE were going to play it. While 
  Ken and Ken scrambled to find the music, Jim and I played an overlong 
  drum roll. We struggled through "O Canada" doing our best to 
  fill the stadium with sound. At the end of it all, the predominately Waterloo-based 
  crowd cheered wildly while a thoroughly disgusted Western band filed off 
  the field.</p>
<p>At half 
  time the Western band did another march-past following which they began 
  to march around the track. Emboldened by our earlier moment of stardom, 
  we sought once again to upstage their performance, setting out in hot 
  pursuit behind them. When they reached the opposite side of the field, 
  they turned and began marching towards the stands. We continued to march 
  20 paces behind them, and upon their reaching the stands, we halted in 
  midfield and marched on the spot. They played well, and I'm sure expected 
  polite applause acknowledging their performance. However, at the precise 
  moment at which they stopped playing, one of our members &ETH; I'm not 
  revealing who- turned suddenly away from the stands and promptly "mooned" 
  all assembled. To this day I have no idea whether the tumultuous cheering 
  which ensued was intended for us or for the Western band=2E..</p>
<p>After that 
  fateful football game, many more players joined the Warriors Band, helping 
  us to make a considerably larger but infrequently-musical sound. The fondest 
  memories of my last two years at Waterloo, are, of attending band practices 
  (always held at games, never beforehand) and going for a pizza afterwards 
  in the music room at the back of "Mother's". Joining the Warriors 
  Band didn't bring me any more good luck, just plenty of good times.</p>

<p>Winter 
  1976</p>
<p>The Warriors 
  Basketball team had to go to Laurentian University in Sudbury to play 
  in the OUAA Championships. I believe Windsor, Laurentian and Ottawa were 
  in the tournament as well. A bunch of fans from Waterloo rented a nice 
  luxury bus to go to Sudbury. There was about 45 of us on board. Ken Creech, 
  myself and a friend of the band, Marshall, travelled with the fans. The 
  three of us comprised the Warriors Band: Ken on trumpet, Marshall on the 
  snare drum and myself on the Bass drum. We had booked a block of rooms 
  at the Cardinal Motel in Sudbury. We occupied the first and second floors 
  at one end of the motel. The University of Ottawa Gee-Gee's basketball 
  team occupied the other end with the "regular" guests in the 
  middle! We stayed overnight on the Friday and travelled all night after 
  the game on Saturday, arriving back in Waterloo early Sunday morning. 
  But what a weekend! We had a victory party back at the motel on Friday 
  night after we beat Windsor. I remember getting maybe 2 - 3 hours of sleep 
  before we made the wake up call Saturday morning in the main hallway with 
  the Warriors Fight Song. We ought to patent that for wake-up calls as 
  people sure rushed into the hallway in a hurry. Maybe fire alarms too! 
  Hmmmm!</p>
<p>On Saturday 
  night in the championship game between Waterloo and Laurentian, the 45 
  of us made more noise than the 600 or 700 "fans" from Laurentian. 
  Those northern folk are a quiet lot! Anyways, they did not have much to 
  cheer about as Waterloo emerged victorious. We ended up having another 
  victory party; this time on the bus back home. We even played the Warriors 
  song in the bus; trumpet, snare drum, voices, and bass drum to boot. The 
  bus driver loved it, as it kept him awake for the long trek home. The 
  Basketball team declared that we were their "6th man" on the 
  floor. We were glad about their appreciation. It was a fringe benefit 
  and a "cherry on the sundae" in making that weekend one of the 
  best I'll remember for a long time.</p>

<p>"Tired,

<p>Sour Notes 
  for Visitors: UW loves its brassy band</p>
<p>"Picture 
  this scene. More than 5,000 basketball fans are jammed into the University 
  of Waterloo Physical Activities Complex. </p>
<p>A deafening 
  roar has just gone up as the Warriors' basketball team strides onto the 
  floor for the pre-game warmup.</p>
<p>Seconds 
  later, the opposition team joins the Warriors on the court and is greeted 
  by a boisterous musical version of the Mickey Mouse Club theme song.</p>
<p>In the 
  world of university athletics, the Mickey Mouse theme is the ultimate 
  putdown.</p>
<p>Although 
  many coaches are reluctant to admit it, more than one visiting team has 
  been intimidated by just such tactics.</p>
<p>The Waterloo 
  Warriors band has struck again. As musical groups go, they're certainly 
  not as famous as the Champagne Music Makers, Milton Delugg's band with 
  a thug or the Mercey Brothers. But at athletic and nonathletics functions 
  involving the University of Waterloo, the Warriors band is in a class 
  by itself and has a notoriety all its own.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The sound 
  the band produces can best be described as loud and at worst, just noisy. 
  But, as the co-ed members of this year's group quickly point out, they've 
  been told they can be a factor in picking up the UW crowds and teams."</p>

<p>"One 
  of the most interesting aspects of the (basketball game versus McMaster) 
  game involved the fans. For a change the opposition sent a large contingent 
  to a Warrior home game. A couple of hundred Mac fans came prepared with 
  a sign and a fleet of cheerleaders. In the first half they tried to compete 
  with the Warrior fan songs (such as "Gang Bang", and the "Warriors 
  Fight Song"), by yelling "Go Mac Go". The Mac fans made 
  the mistake of sitting in front of the Warrior Band. By the second half 
  the Band, as well as the famous rhythmic clapping by the Warrior fans 
  combined to make it hard for their cheerleaders to do their routines, 
  let alone hear their own voices. In the end it was a victory in the stands 
  as well as on the court for the Waterloo team."</p>

<p>Football 
  at Western</p>
<p>One of 
  my clearest memories comes from a trip we made to Western for a football 
  game. We rented a school bus, drove to London, and parked on a residential 
  street in north London, for barbecued hot dogs with Steve Hayman's parents. 
  We then proceeded to J.W. Little Stadium for the "Battle of the Bands". 
  Western's marching band was the enemy. They had lots of money, expensive 
  uniforms, and they liked to march and play music at the same time. Throughout 
  the first half we totally outplayed them. They seemed more concerned to 
  "perform" periodically, while we were primarily concerned with 
  cheering on our Warriors and annoying the Western crowd. When half-time 
  arrived, the Western band assembled and proceeded to march around the 
  field in a dignified manner, playing something impressive. So we decided 
  to "march" with them. We piled on to the field, waved our instruments 
  in the air, (most of us could not play and march at the same time), and 
  ran toward them. When we collided, Western's band was thrown into chaos. 
  They stopped playing, stopped marching, and became generally confused. 
  We continued on, right through them, while the pro-Western crowd cheered 
  for us! As we left the field, a Western alumnus approached our fearless 
  leader CCWB Steve Hayman with a cheque. To this day, I'm not sure if he 
  was supporting our band or just giving us money to ensure that we left 
  town!</p>

<p>Fall 1977</p>
<p>I started 
  in first year math in 1977. I didn't join the band right off - I remember 
  seeing some posters, and thinking "That looks stupid; I'm going to 
  join the concert band", which I did. I didn't get to any football 
  games, but I was talked into going to the first game of the Naismith. 
  UW was playing Laurentian, and we walked in just as the game was starting, 
  and a full house was on their feet and the band, on the other side, was 
  roaring away.</p>
<p>What a 
  surprise!</p>
<p>Like most 
  people who stumble onto a Warriors game for the first time, I had no idea 
  anything like that existed on campus!</p>

<p>Winter 
  1978</p>
<p>I met a 
  guy named Ken Fudurich, fourth-year engineer, and first clarinetist in 
  the concert band. In January, the CBC (which used to show a University 
  Game of the Week) had televised the Guelph at Waterloo game. I watched 
  it at Renison, rather than walking the short distance to the PAC.</p>
<p>I recognized 
  Ken in the WB on TV, he always wore a red plaid lumberjack coat, and at 
  a concert band practice I mumbled something to him about maybe did the 
  band need another trombone player? Ken mentioned that he was going to 
  the basketball game at WLU after the practice, and why didn't I come along. 
  Actually I was kind of reluctant to do so, but he dragged me along anyway.</p>
<p>Ken wasn't 
  sure if people had left for the game yet, so we trekked over to the old 
  office in PAC Blue South, which confused me very much as I thought the 
  game was at Laurier. Eventually we walked down to Laurier, where the game 
  had already started. Ken introduced me to CCWB Mark Hagen, clad in yellow 
  sweatshirt and leather aviator's helmet.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It certainly 
  seemed like an odd group. I remember there was Mark and me on trombone, 
  Ken and Sandy Sonstenes on clarinet, Mac Vomberg on Bass Drum, Jim Snyder 
  on snare, and three of four girls that I sort of knew from Renison, who 
  seemed to be holding but not playing various percussion instruments. No 
  trumpets. Certainly interesting.</p>
<p>The next 
  thing I went to was an away game at McMaster. We had a school bus and 
  went with some fans. It was lots of fun. There were actual trumpet players 
  that time, including Joe Belliveau and Dave Blanchard; right off the bat 
  I was intrigued with Dave who was wearing a black Mennonite hat and had 
  an arrow through his head. Waterloo won the game - I think there was a 
  five-piece Mac band there and we had a lot of fun playing pieces back 
  and forth, louder and faster each time.</p>
<p>I talked 
  a few people at Renison into joining the band, including trumpet player 
  Steve Patterson; at some point Ken F. and I convinced concert band trumpeter 
  Jim Spence to come out.</p>
<p>Waterloo 
  had a good team that year and finished in a tie for first. Steve Patterson 
  and I didn't really know what was going on and bought tickets - we soon 
  learned that was unnecessary. The championship game was against Laurier 
  at the PAC; Laurier's starters were a couple of American guys and the 
  band used to play "The Star Spangled Banner" after "O Canada".</p>
<p>The crowd 
  that day was the largest I can ever remember at the PAC. At this time, 
  practically every game was a sellout and this one was totally packed. 
  Someone in the WLU section brought a sign saying "Waterloo's Band 
  Sucks!", which I thought was great. Had Waterloo won the game, we 
  would have gone to Halifax for the finals (the Band had been the previous 
  year when Waterloo finished 3rd).</p>
<p>I went 
  to see Prof. Staal to see if I could arrange to write my calculus midterm 
  at a different date if this happened, and he got very excited, saying 
  "The Warriors Band? My son was in that! Tell me, how is it going?"</p>
<p>Waterloo 
  lost the final by a few points. The band had 20 or so people in it that 
  day (including Ken F., the first time he'd shown up since recruiting me 
  - when he saw that I'd been trying to arrange some things, he was VERY 
  supportive and said he would have come out more had he known: In retrospect 
  this was one of the most encouraging things to me).</p>
<p>I remember 
  Marshall Pischard, who was in grade 8 and played the snare drum; Mark 
  Hagen used to pick him up for the games in some sort of arrangement that 
  I never understood. Other names come to mind - Jim Brown, a baritone player 
  who had to play the trombone, which he didn't know how to do, since the 
  band only owned 3 trumpets, 1 clarinet and the drums at that point; Mac 
  Vomberg, bass drummer who used to tape up his hand before every game - 
  if you've played the bass drum, you'll know why; Chris Dufault, a funny 
  guy.</p>

<p>Winter 
  1978</p>
<p>The band 
  gets interested in politics. They entered themselves as a candidate for 
  student president, hoping to get more band funding, as they were tired 
  of paying their way themselves. There were polls taken, and they were 
  leading, but the powers-that-be got the band on a technicality. The Band 
  didn't have a student number.</p>

<p>November 
  5, 1979</p>
<p>Laurier 
  refuses to let in the UWO band for free at UWO-WLU football game. CCWB 
  Steve Hayman writes the following letter to the London Free Press:</p>
<p>"Sir: 
  Regarding the Nov.5 Free Press story on Sir Wilfrid Laurier University 
  officials' refusal to admit the University of Western Ontario Mustang 
  Band to a football playoff game without paying, all I can say is that 
  the WLU athletic department is showing extreme good taste.</p>
<p>Clearly, 
  Laurier is only interested in admitting free those groups which show a 
  high calibre of musical ability. The University of Waterloo Warriors Band 
  has never experienced any problems of the type described."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fall 1980</p>
<p>President 
  Burt Matthews gives the band $2000.00. Definitely *the* musical turning 
  point, the band triples the number of instruments it owns, and for the 
  first time UW has to issue purchase orders to pawn shops.</p>

  Band an anodyne to fans</p>
<p>"Last 
  Saturday at the University of Western Ontario's Little Stadium, the University 
  of Waterloo Warriors Band inaugurated its new instruments and new image 
  by trouncing the Western Mustang Band 28 - 24. Highlights of the game 
  included a marching version of "Chicken" at halftime, and antiphonal 
  renditions of "Colonel Bogey" and "Hogan's Heroes" 
  played as duets between two bands 50 yards apart. The Warriors Band established 
  its superiority early in the concert and never looked back, outplaying 
  the Mustang Band 38 tunes to 4. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>As an amusing 
  diversion, a game of "Football" was played between teams from 
  each school between performances of the bands."</p>
<p><br>
  Winter 1980</p>
<p>The BAND 
  exposed their hidden talents at the Grand Hotel's Gong Show. Adding to 
  the renowned musical ability the Band is famous for was a rendition of 
  the William Tell Overture played and amplified on the head of our Chief 
  Percussionist. This was followed by the shaving of a full beard of the 
  Chief Centurion while the Band played "The Stripper". It was 
  a hard way to make $50.00, towards a weekend trip to the CIAU basketball 
  finals in Halifax. That was the same year the band won the J.O. Hemphill 
  trophy for providing outstanding student administration and services.</p>

<p>Summer 
  1981</p>
<p>I don't 
  know how long the Warriors Band logo will be used by the band, but it 
  has been used for the last 10 years, so I thought it would be worth stating 
  how it got developed. It was felt that it was time to develop a logo to 
  appear on the Warriors Band uniforms and that the logo should symbolize 
  Athletics and Music. Around that time most ideas germinated from Steve 
  Hayman and the development of the logo was no exception. Steve Hayman 
  had made up some buttons in 1979 and one of the buttons had a picture 
  of the Warrior Head and a realistic looking trumpet. Some time during 
  the Summer of 1981 Steve Hayman had drawn a "WB" in the shape 
  of trumpet valves</p>
<p>and tubes 
  on a package that he had mailed to me (see one of the scrapbooks). All 
  I did was put the two designs together and stylize the "WB". 
  Kevin Tureski took my drawing to a professional draughtsman who cleaned 
  up the lines.</p>

<p>The Kitchener 
  - Waterloo Record</p>
<p>Strike 
  up the, er, band</p>
<p>"The 
  University of Waterloo Warriors' band called, and David Greenberg and 
  about 20 others answered.</p>
<p>Greenberg 
  and other former band members in town over the weekend donned zany costumes, 
  played brokendown instruments stashed away years ago, and generally celebrated 
  the band's 15th anniversary.</p>
<p>Alumni 
  and current band members joined forces to play rousing tunes for crowds 
  at three basketball games during the three-day Naismith Classic held in 
  the UW gym.</p>
<p>"Some 
  things never change," said Greenberg, 35, an oceanographer at the 
  Bedford Institute in Dartmouth, N.S. "We never did work too much 
  on quality."</p>
<p>The Warriors 
  band, now a tradition at UW basketball, hockey and football games, has 
  a special place in Greenberg's heart, aside from the fact that he married 
  the cymbal player.</p>
<p>He was 
  a founding member back in 1966 "when I got together with a few friends 
  'cause we wanted to get free tickets for the football games."</p>
<p>"There 
  were four of us - two trumpet players and two clarinet players. I gave 
  myself the title 'chief centurion' and never called an election until 
  I left five years later," Greenberg said.</p>
<p>The band's 
  first appearance was at a football game. It was raining and played its 
  repertoire - "the school song and The Charge."</p>
<p>"For 
  some reason the athletics department liked us and offered us uniforms 
  so we started playing regularly," he said.</p>
<p>The group, 
  led by Greenberg in his Second World War army helmet and armed with a 
  trumpet painted bright red by rampaging engineers back in '67, had eight 
  members by the end of the first year.</p>
<p>It now 
  has 40 to 50 regular members, a collection of instruments for those who 
  don't own their own, and a repertoire that includes the school song, The 
  Charge, The Stripper, and themes from Hogan's Heroes and the Muppet Show.</p>
<p>The team 
  now plays at one game a week on the average, but "we maintained tradition 
  and still don't have formal practices," said this year's chief centurion, 
  Peter Oliver. He's a third-year psychology student who took five years 
  of violin lessons and now plays bass drum in the band.</p>
<p>"We 
  take maybe 45 minutes a week to read over new music. We're really just 
  out to have a good time." </p>
<p></p>
<p>Winter 
  1986</p>
<p>While watching 
  TV, Steve Hayman heard the line "This is a waterproof band, nothing 
  drowns them out" and at the same time they showed a band playing 
  in the rain. Steve modified this witty remark and came up with the slogan 
  "The Waterloo Warriors Band, Nothing Drowns Us Out". We agreed 
  that the slogan would be great for a recruitment poster. All we needed 
  was a drawing or picture to go along with the slogan. We could get our 
  picture taken in the rain, but I thought it would be much more humourous 
  if we took a picture of the band in the university swimming pool. So I 
  reserved the pool for our use and Steve Hayman and Kevin Tureski were 
  the photographers. All instruments were allowed in the pool except woodwinds 
  and drums. Everyone was told to be creative and have fun.</p>
<p>Some of 
  my favourite pictures include the band members with instruments lined 
  up on the blocks in a relays race, or the shot of the sousaphone being 
  dropped off the high diving board, or the picture of the band half submerged 
  in water with Bob the Duck floating in the foreground (which was used 
  in the poster). However my favourite picture was the picture (taken from 
  underneath the diving board) of the sousaphone hanging off the end of 
  the diving board. If you looked at this picture out of context, you would 
  not know what it was.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Years after 
  we used the poster in our Fall 1983 recruitment campaign, David Bain said 
  to me that he almost didn't join the Warriors Band because of the poster. 
  He wondered how any band could put their instruments under water. But 
  I think the poster was effective for 2 reasons: the instruments got clean; 
  and David Bain later became CCWB.</p>

<p>Fall, 1982</p>
<p>I still 
  have the wrapper from one of the 1200 chocolate bars we sold in the Fall 
  of 1982 to raise money. I was a frosh, living in Village Zoo. I coordinated 
  the sale of these chocolate bars from my meagre accommodations. Many were 
  sold to myself since there were several cases that I could reach without 
  even getting out of bed. The Basketball team was doing well so we got 
  them to autograph the chocolate bars in the space where we were supposed 
  to stamp who was selling the bars. The autograph incentive, combined with 
  the fact the Village food is lousy, led to tremendous sales. We made a 
  bundle. I saved the big autographs like Peter Savich and Paul van Oorschot. 
  Perhaps I'll try to sell then during this reunion event.</p>

<p>Waterloo 
  was playing Western at a home game at Waterloo Stadium. As it was our 
  halftime show (because it was our home game), Steve Hayman was getting 
  rather uptight because Western was stealing the half time show. So he 
  had us march around the track and through the band as they continued to 
  play. We marched to the entrance where the players would be coming out 
  and formed a line on either side. As we were doing this, Western had just 
  completed their song and the band leader blew the whistle, the whole band 
  counted out loud "1,2,3, F**K You, Waterloo." We were stunned! 
  Preppy Western surprised us all. </p>

  Don McCrae is worried that the Warriors' Band is getting to be too good. 
  "Once upon a time no game was complete without the sound of an errant 
  note reverberating around the gym and disturbing the relative sanctity 
  of things." Now they rarely miss notes and McCrae is afraid they 
  may move to greener pastures in search of a recording contract and thus 
  lose their inspirational cheerleading in favour of a more traditional 
  musical approach."</p>

<p>Winter 
  1983</p>
<p>Since the 
  "Home of the Warrior Band" sign still hangs in the PAC, I thought 
  it would be worth saying how that sign got developed. It was the Athletic 
  Department's idea to hang a Warrior Band sign in the PAC and I was honoured 
  that they had suggested it since the Athletic Department was and still 
  is particular about the PAC's decor. To ensure that the sign was properly 
  done, Molsons was willing to pay for a professional painter as long as 
  their name appeared on part of the sign. I drew up the simple design (see 
  scrapbook) and the sign was painted.</p>
<p>Years later 
  when the sponsor changed to Labatts, someone painted over Molsons with 
  Labatts, and now Labatts has been replaced with the Warriors Band 25th 
  Anniversary crest - and looks even better.</p>

<p>Winter, 
  1983</p>
<p>I was dating 
  a guy on the varsity basketball team, and he was always somewhat embarrassed 
  when he heard me play the cymbals for "O Canada" at the start 
  of every home game.</p>
<p>Well, during 
  one game as it was, and probably still is the tradition of standing up 
  until the first basket is scored. I was up and down so much that I think 
  the cymbals were getting rather heavy so I set them down and started clapping. 
  All of a sudden, all everyone heard was the loud, resonating sound of 
  the cymbals hitting the framework of the grandstand as they made their 
  way to the ground. I was "major league" embarrassed as it was 
  obvious I dropped them, as I couldn't sucker anyone into picking them 
  up for me. My boyfriend denied knowing me to the rest of his teammates.</p>

<p>Winter 
  1983</p>
<p>The band 
  never did go to many hockey games during the Winter term in 1983. Why... 
  because we were very busy going to other sporting events, the hockey arena 
  was always freezing, and the hockey team was so bad, we could not have 
  helped. But the new hockey coach desperately wanted us to attend so I 
  promised him that we would attend at least one game. So early in the Winter 
  term of 1983, we gathered at the PAC and loaded up two cars and headed 
  out to the McCormick arena. It wasn't until we reached the arena that 
  we realized that we had filled the other car with frosh and they had no 
  idea where to go. Thirty minutes after the game started, the other car 
  arrived. Once we started playing in the arena we made such a big sound 
  that the referee stopped the game, skated over and told us to keep it 
  down.</p>

<p>Halifax, 
  March l983???</p>
<p>Tired of 
  waiting for the band's mammoth pizza order, Bernie Jansen and I left for 
  a walk, leaving the others in the vans. We were looking for entries in 
  the unofficial Tacky Souvenir Contest, so we enter this shopping mall 
  near Dave Greenberg's place in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>And stop 
  in our tracks.</p>
<p>"My 
  God, Bernie, that's it. That's the winner of the Tacky Souvenir Contest!" 
  The mall's supermarket had a lifesize C-3PO display advertising his new 
  cereal from Kellogg's. C-3PO - android from Star Wars. The Golden Warrior 
  for the Warriors Band pantheon of deities.</p>
<p>Now what 
  do we do? We couldn't just walk out with the display- that would be theft 
  and Nova Scotia would deport us Ontarians for it. "Go and talk to 
  that cashier," suggests Bernie. The Cashier looks up as we approach 
  the</p>
<p>register. 
  "Uh, hi, we have a strange request. Could we have that C&ETH;3PO 
  for a tacky souvenir contest?" The cashier blinks in surprise. "I 
  don't think so, but you should talk to the manager about this," she 
  replies, pointing to the other end of the store. We thank her and head 
  for that end of the store. We subject the gentleman in the long white 
  coat to the same question. "Gee, that's nice, but I'm the assistant 
  manager. You'll have to come back next Tuesday when the manager returns." 
  "We can't do that! We're from Ontario and we'll be leaving on Friday!" 
  "Oh. Tell you what: why don't you guys just take it and I'll turn 
  my back, okay?" "Hey, that's great. Thanks a lot!"</p>
<p>Bernie 
  and I rush back to the display. We look around. I pick up C&ETH;3PO and 
  he tackles the door. We run back to the van, and knock on a window for 
  the band to let us in.</p>
<p>As soon 
  as the sliding door opens, cries of "Where did you get that from?" 
  accompany Dave Bain's shocked "YOU DIDN'T JUST STEAL THAT?"</p>
<p>Bernie 
  and I grin somewhat sheepishly. "Well, yeah, we did, but the management 
  condoned it..."</p>

<p>We took 
  it to Dave Greenberg's house (he hosted the pizza party). We turned the 
  van lights off, Steve set it on the doorstep, rang the bell, and hid around 
  from the door. Dave opened the door, stared at C3PO, then yelled "Hayman, 
  where the hell are you?" and laughed.</p>

<p>UW Gazette</p>
<p>Volume 
  24, Number 23</p>
<p>"The 
  Warriors Band members are not a bunch of lunatics. Really. Band leader 
  Steve Hayman insists that the group has some talented musicians who practise 
  regularly. It's just the image of the Band that is disorganized and dishevelled, 
  he maintains.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Hayman, 
  who likes to be called the "Chief Centurion", says the Band 
  wants to raise money so they can accompany UW's basketball Warriors to 
  this year's national championships in Halifax.</p>
<p>In keeping 
  with the Band's style, organizers are leaving fundraising and other details 
  until the last minute. Raffle tickets will be sold at basketball games, 
  as soon as they are printed, Hayman says. And Band members are going to 
  'blitz' student residences to sell tickets as well.</p>
<p>Of course, 
  they're not quite sure yet what the prize will be. A colour television 
  is a strong possibility.</p>
<p>Hayman 
  is all in favour of the "party atmosphere" the Band creates 
  as cheerleaders of sorts. He likes being part of the very vocal Waterloo 
  fan club - UW fans are known "far and wide for their quality", 
  he says modestly.</p>
<p>He feels 
  it's crucial for the Band to maintain its off-the-cuff style. He wants 
  to avoid imitating the polished professionalism of some well-funded bands, 
  notably the University of Western Ontario Mustang Band.</p>
<p>What's 
  wrong with the Western Band?</p>
<p>Well, for 
  one thing, Hayman says, the musicians are confused. With their white cowboy 
  hats, they look like they're from western Canada. He's not at all approving 
  of their slick uniforms; Hayman prefers the more casual hockey sweaters 
  the Warriors' Band wears.</p>
<p>And there 
  is no doubt in his mind that the UW musicians have more fun. That's the 
  main attraction for him.</p>
<p>Fun was 
  the reason behind the Band's sudden notoriety when they played Easter 
  Parade and Here Comes Peter Cottontail at Waterloo's most recent Santa 
  Claus parade. They also included a Beach Boys medley of hits for variety.</p>
<p>In a rambunctious 
  mood, the Band decided to march through a Brewer's Retail store. Unfortunately 
  they were stalled early when the bass drum refused to fit through the 
  door.</p>
<p>The crazy 
  spirit is contagious, it seems. Hayman recalls a Windsor game the Band 
  travelled to see. They were honoured when the opposition asked them to 
  play the pre-game national anthem.</p>
<p>But they 
  had to protest when the lights were completely turned off and they couldn't 
  read a single note of music.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Most of 
  the people in the Band are fairly accomplished," claims Donna Green, 
  the Band's Vice-President in Charge of Buying Sheet Music. "We have 
  real music, stands, everything," she says confidently.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Actually 
  Hayman takes his cheerleading pretty seriously. He says he gets a great 
  deal of satisfaction knowing he's helping the team in its fight for victory.</p>
<p>With pride, 
  he says the Band is getting better every year and he hopes it will continue 
  to prosper and "keep doing zany things."</p>

<p>Warriors 
  Band: Goodwill Ambassadors</p>
<p>"A 
  new group of goodwill ambassadors has emerged at the University of Waterloo. 
  We've known about them for seventeen or so years, but it wasn't until 
  last weekend that their presence was truly appreciated.</p>
<p>Who are 
  they? We know this group of fun-loving musicians as the Warriors Band.</p>
<p>Those who 
  were at the Metro Centre in Halifax last weekend during the CIAU men's 
  basketball championships were truly appreciative of the Band's mere presence, 
  not to mention their spirit and musical ability. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>At the 
  games, the Band made it entertaining, even when the action wasn't. The 
  Warriors Band's unique version of the "2001" theme, with Chief 
  Centurion Steve Hayman's drum solo, was an instant success with the Metro 
  crowd.</p>
<p>With Waterloo 
  not in the final game, a coin toss dictated that Brandon would be cheered 
  for during the televised event.</p>
<p>It led 
  to Dave "Crash" Bain's impromptu imitation of the Victoria mascot, 
  using an old helmet with strips of yellow paper for horns, and a battered 
  cymbal and plastic horn as a shield. This continued for the rest of the 
  game, leading to many enjoyable moments.</p>
<p>Like the 
  CN Tower, Disneyland, or the Astrodome, the Warriors Band is a great entity 
  to have around, but something that we at Waterloo take for granted from 
  their constant presence. The applause and laughter of the crowds at the 
  Metro centre, who had probably never seen or heard the Band before, must 
  have made the trip worthwhile for our musicians.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Warriors 
  Band have called themselves "One of the Bands in Canada" for 
  a while. It's obviously true, but let's add a superlative or two to that 
  phrase. How 'bout "The Band in Canadian Basketball"?</p>

<p>Returning 
  from Halifax - driving along the shore of the St. Laurence, I had just 
  got out of the passenger seat of the van, to go back and lie down, when 
  Dave Waddington (who was driving) said "Hang on!" The van, travelling 
  at full highway cruising speed in bad weather (75 - 80 MPH) entered a 
  white-out and Dave skillfully swerved around 3 or 4 cars buried in drifts. 
  The cord of my walkman, which was clipped to the bass drum, wrapped around 
  my neck and began to strangle me as I flipped over the seat behind me.</p>
<p>Later, 
  Steve Hayman told me he was lying down trying to sleep in the back of 
  the other van, when he heard John Oldfield yell "Hang on" Steve's 
  last thought before they entered the whiteout was "I can't see what's 
  happening. I'm going to die, and I don't know why."</p>

<p>The Yugoslav

  Steve Hayman had us shouting out the phrase everytime the Yugos had the

<p>We went 
  to Western's Homecoming, we were in the parade. We didn't have a lot of 
  cars, and we had no real way of getting the drum to London, so we rented 
  one of those big busses. We blew our budget on it. At the time, the federal 
  government was trying to encourage marching bands, so they promised to 
  bail us out if we got into trouble. Some one - or &ETH; other had to leave 
  early so he drove - his car broke down about half way there. We got to 
  London at some ungodly hour and marched through the parade; when we got 
  to the campus, various residences were having a water fight across the 
  parade route. They didn't know who we were and we got through unscathed. 
  Our rugby team was playing outside the stadium, so we stopped and cheered 
  them on. At the stadium, they wanted to search the drum and the tubas, 
  and told us not to step on the track. This is where the picture with the 
  band with one toe on the track was taken. We lost the game 72-0. This 
  was the game where they invited the quarterback of an undefeated campus 
  rec flag football team to play. After the game, we had to rush back to 
  avoid paying extra for the bus, so we went to the Hayman's house and ordered 
  pizza. Eventually, we had to pay double for the bus, but the government 
  picked up the tab. This is where the federal deficit came from. OK, I 
  made the part about the feds up. The rest is true.</p>

<p>The math

  like; "Go to the game: 7:30, Seagram Stadium". The game started 
  at 7:00. The band read the math society banner, except for Beth Bondi, 
  Donald Duench and me. At the time I was trying to play trumpet, since 
  I happened to have one. Steve Hayman comes up at about 7:00, and the announcer 
  asks if we're going to play 'O Canada.' I hand Steve the trumpet, and 
  we perform 'O Canada' with 2 flutes, a recorder, and a trumpet played 
  by a trombonist, while the rest of the band killed themselves laughing 
  out in the parking lot.</p>

<p>The Warriors, 
  at Varsity Arena in Toronto, had defeated McMaster in a regional final 
  to advance to the Final Four in Halifax. (this was when they had a four-team 
  final tournament, as opposed to eight in the 1970's and present) There 
  was a high-school final that night on the same court, so the Warriors 
  weren't allowed to cut down the nets, as is a custom for victorious basketball 
  teams. But, Steve Hayman took a blank poster, drew a basketball rim &amp; 
  net on it, and took it over to the players=2E Big (7'0") Randy Norris 
  cut down the "net."</p>

  a taxi downtown to meet the incoming vanload of enthusiastic (?) bandmembers. 
  With some time to kill before they arrived, we went to a restaurant/bar 
  across the street. As we entered, we noticed that the entire bar was populated 
  by rowdy, inebriated supporters of one of the Maritime teams. We decided 
  to try another spot, but before we left, one final gesture was necessary. 
  We pulled our band sweaters out, and raised them over our heads. The noise 
  of the bar was gradually replaced by a loud chorus of boos and catcalls. 
  The overall effect made the flight from Ontario seem very worthwhile somehow.</p>

  for the UW building which is to bear his name.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Most of 
  UW's deans and other senior officials were on hand along with the building's 
  architects and project managers, faculty and staff members, students, 
  a solemn four-year old, uniformed security officers keeping an eye on 
  things, and the Warriors' Band, which greeted Davis's arrival with "Hail 
  to the Chief" and "Land of Hope and Glory".</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In his 
  ceremonial remarks, kept brief because the wind was rising and the shadows 
  were lengthening, Davis commented on the band, which he called "the 
  Waterloo university symphony orchestra", and on his friendship with 
  UW's dean of computing and communications, Wes Graham, who lived in the 
  same residence hall at the University of Toronto where Davis spent his 
  undergraduate days."</p>

<p>Before

  we could be out within 30 minutes, since we had to be at the game. They 
  assured us that it could be done.</p>
<p>Naturally, 
  the waitress did the usual thing; sat us down and abandoned us. Since 
  the menus were printed on the placemats, we decided to write down everybody's 
  orders, and just hand them to the waitress when she returned, thus saving 
  time. So, we go around the table, getting orders and writing them on a 
  napkin.</p>
<p>We come 
  to Ed Kozak.</p>
<p>"I'd 
  like a quarter chicken" he says. (Note: This is a packaged meal that 
  comes with fries, coleslaw, whatever.) "OK, one quarter chicken for 
  Ed."</p>
<p>Ed is still 
  looking at the menu - he hasn't ordered a drink yet. "I'd like a 
  half chicken" says Ed. "OK, change Ed's quarter chicken to a 
  half chicken."</p>
<p>"No, 
  No! I want a quarter chicken AND a half chicken!"</p>

<p>The first 
  international Warriors Band trip, to SUNY in Buffalo. Two vanloads of 
  enthusiastic band members left Waterloo, attempting to cross the border 
  at Niagara Falls. I was driving the lead van. At the crossing, the overly 
  suspicious Nazi-American border guard snarled "Are you all Canadian 
  citizens?" I suddenly realized Hans Ziemann mentioning something 
  about his citizenship, so my reply of "Yes" probably sounded 
  less than convincing. He said "Are you sure?" I looked around 
  at the van occupants, and tried to sound confident. "Yes."</p>
<p>The guard 
  directed us over the another building, where he entered with me in tow. 
  "This guy isn't sure if everyone in his van is Canadian" I sat 
  down, resigned to a long delay. I glanced out the window, and saw the 
  Warrior team bus pull up outside. I saw several of the players pointing 
  at our van. After a short delay, the team bus pulled away, and I caught 
  a glimpse of Don McCrae. He was leaning forward, and pointing at the various 
  Band members shivering miserably around the van. That was the only time 
  I ever saw him laugh.</p>

<p>"The 
  latest in a long line of Warrior band exploits occurred at the CIAU basketball 
  all-Canadian awards banquet. As Waterloo's Peter Savich was introduced 
  as a member of the head table, the dignified atmosphere was shattered 
  by the now familiar Waterloo fight song. Following the song were about 
  20 members of the Warrior band making a grand, if uninvited entrance. 
  They even managed to stay for some free dessert.</p>
<p>Incidents 
  like this are becoming familiar occurrences for the band. Ontario basketball 
  fans are well acquainted with the Waterloo support squad, and CIAU spectators 
  are beginning to know them equally as well. This is the band's fifth championship

  "I like to have my evenings free," he explains, "for FASS 
  and Warriors Band and Theatre Sports and all those things that keep me 
  from going home and eating proper meals and vacuuming the rugs."</p>
<p>...And 
  the Warriors Band, once the centre of his life (he was its Chief Centurion 
  last year), is less time-consuming since he has passed the torch to people 
  who are still students.</p>
<p>(He plays 
  the clarinet - "very loudly, which is an asset, but very poor technique". 
  But his real role in the Band is ownership of a soldering torch, vital 
  to keep instruments in playing shape.)"</p>

<p>The band 
  went Christmas carolling on Hallowe'en. We stopped to see guys like:</p>
<p>- Bob McKillop 
  (football coach). Bob's wife was out of town, so he went to 'phone her 
  and tell her about these crazy people who had just appeared at his door. 
  Left to phone her just as we started playing "Tequila/McKillop" 
  for the first time to his face, so we had to do it twice. Bob is one of 
  the few people who really appreciates what this band is all about. His 
  neighbours loved us!</p>
<p>- Doug 
  Wright (president of UW). He invited us in for cider or beer (Labatt Classic, 
  at that!). He had had a quiet night - few kids on his block except us.</p>
<p>- Carl 
  Totzke (Athletic Director). He lived in the sticks and wasn't home; we 
  bothered/played for his neighbour because we couldn't tell in the dark 
  which house was which. Neighbour forgave us anyway.</p>
<p>- We dropped 
  by a Warrior hockey game to say HI to McCrae and the hockey coach, and 
  whoever else was there. Almost got a bench minor for the team. The refs 
  didn't appreciate us playing during action on the ice. We felt bad.</p>
<p>- CKCO 
  TV. They weren't expecting us. We got there about 10:30 as they were preparing 
  for the 11:20 newscast. They put us in the background over the weather 
  report. Roy Wood's bunny suit looked really sharp.</p>

<p>Catch the

  groups who will be throwing that spirit your way, and have been doing 
  so for two decades, is the Warrior band.</p>
<p>Spontaneity 
  and enthusiasm are the reasons for their success at both home and away 
  games. The Naismith tournament marks the twentieth year of the band once 
  named the Baden and Elmira Beer Hall Boys. They have undergone several 
  name-changes carousing now under the alias University of Waterloo band.</p>
<p>The Warriors 
  band is an unofficial member of the Athletics Department. For this Naismith 
  tournament they will provide a half time show consisting of the history 
  of the band, introduction of former band centurions, the school song and 
  a string of past and present popular songs. For all those interested they 
  will be having a get together on Friday and Saturday night at the Grad 
  House.</p>

  to all of the members of the University of Waterloo Warriors band for 
  their participation in the Olympic Torch Relay Ceremonies at Kitchener

<p>We appreciated 
  the enthusiasm that you band members exhibited despite the chilling temperatures 
  and the effects that the cold temperatures had on many of your instruments. 
  </p>
<p>We hope 
  that you enjoyed being a part of the Olympic Torch Relay Ceremonies in 
  Kitchener, and to be able to Share the Flame/Celebrate the Spirit with 
  several thousand other people.</p>

<p>Waterloo

<p>"With 
  a total weekend turnout of 18,000 excited basketball fans for the CIAU 
  finals, Halifax is definitely the basketball capital of Canada. The Axemen 
  had the home town support right to the wire in the final game against 
  Brandon, the national champs. But the real excitement for Acadia fans 
  was the night before when the Axemen took the "David and Goliath" 
  match against University of Victoria Vikings 86 - 83.</p>
<p>Amid the 
  excitement of one of the best college basketball games in years, came 
  the rousing sound of the University of Waterloo band playing the old Acadia 
  song "Stand Up and Cheer". It seems their band leader Steve</p>
<p>Hayman 
  had heard the song down east, and worked up the arrangement. He was happy 
  to pass along the music score to Acadia. Jeff Smith and Brian Johnston 
  have fine tuned it for various instruments. Now we've really "got 
  the steam, Boom! Boom!"."</p>

<p>For those

  even that was only a Bb chord (almost).</p>
<p>We also 
  demolished a number of previously quite acceptable pieces of music, and 
  had our own unique versions of "The Last Post", and "Taps" 
  played as the box was actually lowered into the ground.</p>
<p>Not content 
  with this, they invited us back to a social gathering, and forced us to 
  drink beer, and gave us tickets for door prizes. Then, they managed to 
  make me win a T-shirt.</p>
<p>At any

<p>We sent 
  them a copy of 'Easy Steps to Band', complete with geeky looking people 
  showing the 'correct' way to hold and play instruments. </p>
<p>We sent 
  it to them in the fall, by way of inter-university mail. They did not 
  receive it until mid winter. It turns out, that despite having a HUGE

<p>The Lance 
  (U. of Windsor's Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>"It's 
  gotta be tough being a Waterloo Warrior football fan. It's probably even 
  worse being a member of the pep band.</p>
<p>I mean, 
  these hearty Warrior fans come out in rain or snow travelling miles and 
  miles, to cheer on a team that hasn't won in thirty straight OUAA regular 
  season contests. </p>
<p>Well, the 
  wandering minstrels and their rag-tag bunch of gridiron goofups made their 
  way into Windsor last weekend, to take on the mighty Lancers in our homecoming 
  game. Playing in other team's homecoming games is</p>
<p>nothing 
  new to these guys, who don't even have their own homecoming, preferring 
  to wait until basketball season, when the team is more likely to win their 
  game. If the other teams had their way, Waterloo would probably play seven 
  homecoming games.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>With (a 
  Windsor) victory certain, I began to have this strange feeling of sadness, 
  which first came over me during the Lancers' pivotal drive.</p>
<p>Waterloo 
  played their guts out in this meaningless game, and for a while, during 
  the three penalties, I almost wanted them to win.</p>
<p>I then 
  looked over at the Waterloo band, still playing their hearts out, in a 
  passion of scholastic pride. I then wondered how they could do it week 
  after week. The reason suddenly became clear. They have as much dedication 
  as the footballers themselves.</p>
<p>The Warriors 
  football team gave all, who were interested in finding it, a lesson. They 
  told us not to quit, especially when everyone expects you to." </p>

<p>Letter

<p>Kitchener 
  - Waterloo Record</p>
<p>Lasting 
  Streak</p>
<p>"I've 
  been a faithful fan of University of Waterloo's football Warriors for 
  many years now, and I've finally figured out the cause of the current 
  losing streak. It's my fault.</p>
<p>This finally 
  dawned on me last week. Even though I've moved away from Waterloo, I've 
  been to more than 90 per cent of the games during the streak.</p>
<p>However, 
  last week I had to go to a wedding and couldn't get to Seagram Stadium 
  until near the end of the game. I arrived with about two minutes left 
  in the game and Waterloo leading Guelph 21 - 17.</p>
<p>It is hard 
  to express how excited I was, how proud I was that the team was finally 
  going to end the streak (especially against those Gryphon goofs) and that 
  I was going to be there to see it.</p>
<p>Guess what 
  happened. Mere moments after I got there, Guelph scored the winning touchdown.</p>
<p>What can 
  I say other that "I'm sorry." I will make this pledge: I promise 
  not to go to the game this weekend against York, and I look forward to 
  news of a Warriors victory!</p>

<p>Football 
  game at Esther Shiner Stadium in North York. The Warriors took in a 33-game 
  long streak. From all I knew about Waterloo and York, this would be the 
  best chance for the Warriors to break the streak. And they did. It got 
  to the point that we knew the Warriors would win and when the game was 
  over, it was there - a win, the streak over. But other than yelling a 
  little bit, nothing spectacular in post-game celebration. Nobody really 
  knew (or remembered) how to celebrate a football victory.</p>
<p>Additionally, 
  as a Waterloo alumnus and WB member living in Toronto, I had the choice 
  of going to that game or the Jay vs Orioles. Went to the football and 
  when it was over I went to the Sky Dome and just before I got there, Tom 
  Henke threw the final pitch to win the AL East.</p>

<p>Warrior 
  football fan reflects</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"The 
  Warriors band told me that going to J.W. Little Stadium to fact the Mustangs 
  would be an experience in and of itself. They didn't go nearly far enough. 
  Never have I seen such a disgusting display of childish arrogance at the 
  university level.</p>
<p>Yet the 
  Warriors kept fighting, moving the ball with authority and holding the 
  vaunted Mustang defence at bay, within striking distance of the snotty 
  home squad just two minutes before halftime.</p>
<p>Then the 
  bomb hit.</p>
<p>First a 
  single Mustang receive slipped behind the coverage, and the quarterback 
  found him for a touchdown. Then there was a clocked punt for another touchdown. 
  Then yet another major on a long pass.</p>
<p>In those 
  two minutes, at 35 - 7, all reasonable hopes for a Warrior victory were 
  snuffed out.</p>
<p>The second 
  half was an exercise in drudgery. The action got the Warriors no closer, 
  and as time ticked away, those arrogant fools began to mock the Waterloo 
  fans. Their sole rationalization for their taunting and obnoxious behaviour 
  was the fact that they were winning.</p>
<p>But we 
  would have the last laugh.</p>
<p>About two 
  minutes before the end of the game, Waterloo fans began a groundswell 
  of applause for the team that has represented them so well. It continued 
  so loud and so long that we could not hear the Mustang preppies bid their 
  team, and us, farewell.</p>
<p>At the 
  end of the game, the Warriors squad came over to our side and thanked 
  us for our support, which only increased the cheering. As we continued 
  to yell, the transparent oafs left the stadium stunned.</p>
<p>They couldn't 
  understand why we were cheering. We had LOST. But as we remained in their 
  stadium, we knew that we had won. We showed what is was to have class, 
  even in defeat."</p>

<p>The KW 
  Santa Claus Parade</p>
<p>As per 
  usual, the band rode on the university float - the same one they recycle 
  every year. The band was cold, but sounding not too bad, when disaster 
  hit. The front right wheel on the tractor pulling the float exploded. 
  It was water filled, so some members of the crowd got wet feet, and the 
  band received a very large shock. In typical band </p>
<p>fashion, 
  we merely leapt off the float, and began to saunter down the street playing 
  all the while. We received numerous compliments from parade organizers 
  for our quick thinking, and for continuing in the parade. What else could 
  we do? We had a very large captive audience who wouldn't leave no matter 
  what, until Santa had gone by.</p>

<p>Winter

<p>The Ryersonian</p>
<p>"I 
  spent the weekend as the unofficial hanger-on with the Waterloo Warriors 
  Band.</p>
<p>The rag-tag 
  bunch showed up in force an hour before the Trois-Rivieres - PEI game. 
  As was the case last year, the band was invited by the Nationals' organizing 
  committee to play at the entire tournament.</p>
<p>So there 
  they were, shoved up in the rafters behind the goal, attired in their 
  gaudy white, gold, and black sweaters, with some red trim.</p>
<p>They were 
  going through their repertoire of "The Stripper", "The 
  Muppet Show Theme," and unbelievably, "Alexander's Ragtime Band". 
  But, as in every sporting event they invade, the band always chooses a 
  favourite. The picked the PEI Panthers, as facing them in the tournament's 
  finale would be much better than mighty UQTR.</p>
<p>So, they 
  cranked out a hastily-written arrangement of "The Pink Panther". 
  Their rhythmic cheer of "W-A-R-R-I-OR-S" was easily replaced 
  by "P-A-N-T-H-E-R-S", delivered within a heartbeat. Yet they 
  figured their raucous cheers would be muffled by quick-skating UQTR.</p>
<p>The next 
  day, Warrior fans came out in droves to Varsity Arena, clearly prepared 
  for the occasion. The fans brought duffel bangs stuffed with banners, 
  monstrous school flags, and pots and pans as noisemakers.</p>
<p>"Hit 
  him, kill him, rip his face off!" the band yelled in unison, desperately 
  hoping to break the tension mounting in the largely pro-Warriors crowd. 
  </p>
<p>(the warriors 
  lose 1-0.)</p>
<p>And, after 
  the split-second of shock, came the strains of "The Black, White 
  and Gold", Waterloo's school song, and then, the fans wailing "WAAAAARRRRIORRRS", 
  so loudly, it wasn't clear who won the game."</p>

<p>Fall 1991</p>
<p>The story 
  of how I got started in the Warriors Band goes way back to Frosh Week 
  of 1991. Fresh out of high school, I was looking for something to distract 
  me from my upcoming studies. One of the Frosh Week activities happened 
  to be a pep rally, intending to generate enthusiasm among the Frosh as 
  well as introduce them to the football team.</p>
<p>As I stood 
  in the darkened gymnasium, the near-deafening roar of the eager Frosh 
  was penetrated by a din and clatter which resolved itself into an off-key, 
  off-tempo culmination of something that sounded vaguely like the theme 
  from the television series, "The Adventures of Robin Hood." 
  You know, the black and white version that starred Richard Greene as Robin 
  Hood that aired on YTV two years ago. It was at that point that I realized 
  what I must do; and the next Thursday I showed up for what would be the 
  first of many zany Warriors Band practices.</p>
<p>When I 
  arrived in the band office, I was greeted by Leslie Ann, who asked my 
  what instrument I played. Before the word 'trumpet' was completely out 
  of my mouth, Leslie Ann was shouting excitedly to the other band members 
  that they had recruited another much-needed trumpeter.</p>
<p>After the 
  initial moment of exalted worship and lengthy introductions, I found that 
  this band was completely unlike anything I had seen in high school.</p>
<p>At the 
  end of the practice, they surprised me once again (one of the lesser-known 
  talents of the Warriors Band), by telling me that we were playing our 
  first engagement in Toronto. Wow. Not only was I a full member, I would 
  get to debut with the Warriors Band in Varsity Stadium (not the prettiest 
  stadium, but the name, the name). After that experience, I knew that the 
  Warriors Band was the place for me (Yes, I do find circling Varsity Stadium 
  while blasting "Barenaked Ladies" on the van stereo appealing).</p>
<p>I really 
  became the band member that I am when we took the road trip to York. On 
  the way, while listening to "Barenaked Ladies" I considered 
  the Hilarity Factor of standing up at some point during the game and yelling 
  "Alas, poor YORK! I knew him, Horatio". Based upon my calculations, 
  I thought it would be funny.</p>
<p>So after 
  the tinny recording of the national anthem and before I sat down, I yelled 
  my quotation. When the band had recovered from its two&ETH;second shocked 
  silence, most of the more intellectual members broke out in uncontrollable 
  laughter. After the trouncing of the Yeomen 44-1, and jumping on the Bandwagon 
  (a Thrifty rent-avan), we started back to the friendly confines of Waterloo. 
  Dave "King of Wipeout Drum-Solos" Confalonieri started calling 
  me "Horatio", and did not stop for quite some time.</p>
<p>From that 
  time forth, at every football game, a Shakespearean quotation would be 
  ready immediately following the national anthem. I have been requested 
  to do encores when fewer than half the band members had actually heard 
  the quotation.</p>
<p>The wildest 
  and craziest experience I have had as a band member has to be the road 
  trip to Western. Jim Spence (my second favourite trumpet player next to 
  myself) and I insisted on being frisked at least twice by the cute Special 
  Events girls. Once inside, we were strictly ordered not to provoke the 
  Western fans. (That was the first game where I elected to not yell my 
  Shakespearean quotation). Projectiles of every description were raining 
  down on the band, demonstrating the true nature of the Western fans (and 
  they were worried about what WE were going to do). It was fun drowning 
  out the Western Mustangs Elementary School Track Sitting/Marching (?) 
  Band.</p>
<p>As "Shakespeare" 
  I have enjoyed the start of my career as a Warriors Band member, as well 
  as enduring virtually every kind of weather Seagram Stadium has to offer 
  (rain, snow, freezing temperatures, brilliant sunshine). In that regard, 
  basketball is one of my favourite sports. </p>
<p>The basketball 
  season will (as I have been told) bring out the best in the Warriors Band 
  (wouldn't you play your best if you knew you weren't freezing your butt 
  off on some splintered old wooden bench? I sure would)=2E So far, I haven't 
  seen much basketball action, but it has promise.</p>
<p>At this 
  time, I would just like to thank all the band members past and present, 
  who have made all this possible. I would also like to say, hey, this is 
  where I want to be:" in one of THE bands in Canada.</p>

<p>The Warriors 
  Band celebrates its 25th anniversary. I had the fun of working with an 
  excellent group of rather strange people to organize the event. My thanks 
  to the following people (in no particular order): Patricia Clarke, Dave 
  Confalonieri, Chris Jacob, Megan Marlatt, Janette Pluister, Jim Spence, 
  Shelley Clark, Martin Vierula, Rob Tyson, and Rick Rowan. We had over 
  80 WB alumni turn up at varying times over the weekend. The committee 
  arranged for souvenir 25th Anniversary mugs, WB pins, and this edition 
  of the WB history. Old friendships were renewed, new ones formed, and 
  the most popular sentence of the weekend "Do you remember when...=2E...".</p>
<p>The basketball 
  team co-operated with the reunion committee's wishes and made it the to 
  final of the Naismith Tournament. We unfortunately lost to St. F-X, but 
  had the opportunity to watch some exciting basketball.</p>
<p>Thanks 
  to all alumni who returned to campus and shared stories of old band events, 
  and to those who sent in stories and pictures for the history. I couldn't 
  have done it without you.</p>
<p>Thanks 
  band for 6 years of fun, frolic, and friends. </p>
