<h1>About the Band</h1>
<h2>We're pretty awesome!</h2>

<div class="justify">
  <p>The Warriors Band is a student-run pep band for the University of Waterloo. Main events where the band 
  creates lots of noise include football, basketball, hockey, volleyball, soccer and even the odd rugby 
  games. The band has been known to attend other functions such as opening ceremonies, city parades, and 
  even weddings.</p>

  <p>Join the fun! There are no auditions, and instruments are provided (as long as we've got one). No 
  practice or event is mandatory, so you can go home or get that hugely important assignment done. Of 
  course the more stuff you come to the more fun you'll have. For practice and every other event, we meet 
  first in the Band Office (PAC 1001). After that, we'll be at the event, or just playing outside, near 
  the SLC. For more information contact 
  <a href="mailto:warriorsband@gmail.com">The Band</a> or just show up at a practice on Thursdays at 
  5:30 pm (PAC 1001).</p>
